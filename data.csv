1,455786,0,0,Hashtable? Edit: An array is O(1) lookup because a[i] is just syntactic sugar for *(a+i). In other words to get O(1) you need either a direct pointer or an easily-calculated pointer to every element (along with a good-feeling that the memory you're about to lookup is for your program). In the absence of having a pointer to every element it's not likely to have an easily-calculated pointer (and know the memory is reserved for you) without contiguous memory. Of course it's plausible (if terrible) to have a Hashtable implementation where each lookup's memory address is simply *(a + hash(i)) Not being done in an array i.e. being dynamically created at the specified memory location if you have that sort of control.. the point is that the most efficient implementation is going to be an underlying array but it's certainly plausible to take hits elsewhere to do a WTF implementation that still gets you constant-time lookup. Edit2: My point is that an array relies on contiguous memory because it's syntactic sugar but a Hashtable chooses an array because it's the best implementation method not because it's required. Of course I must be reading the DailyWTF too much since I'm imagining overloading C++'s array-index operator to also do it without contiguous memory in the same fashion.. ,6.0,2021-01-18,0,2023-08-10,Bremen,271999.0,2072.0,455781,2,3.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

Is there someway I can make the VIM line break after 80 characters. I dont want the text to wrap around but create a new line. And I wish it would break off the complete last word. So instead of   fo in the previous and o in the next line can it break with foo in the next line? When I end my comment and press enter I get a # in the new line. This is cool but when I delete # and want to start a line of code I dont get syntax highlighting there. It still thinks what Im typing is a comment. Is this a bug or am I doing it wrong? One more thing is that I have set the shiftwidth to 4. But when I press Ctrl+S to save the document the cursor jumps to the beginning of the sentence.

The WPF dialog is hidden behind the base C++ app and is not disabled unless I manually change IsEnabled. Not ideal but it works. Now that MFC dialog is closed. Now for some reason the base MFC app is enabled when it should still be disabled due to the WPF dialog not having been closed. That's bad as it now allows the user to do crazy things while the WPF dialog is still open.  I have a feeling that it would work better if I could set parent dialogs correctly.

27,445059,455286,3,So earlier I answered my own question on thinking in vectors in R. But now I have another problem which I can't 'vectorize.' I know vectors are faster and loops slower but I can't figure out how to do this in a vector method: I have a data frame (which for sentimental reasons I like to call my.data) which I want to do a full marginal analysis on. I need to remove certain elements one at a time and 'value' the data frame then I need to do the iterating again by removing only the next element. Then do again... and again... The idea is to do a full marginal analysis on a subset of my data. Anyhow I can't conceive of how to do this in a vector efficient way.  I've shortened the looping part of the code down and it looks something like this: for (j in my.data$item[my.data$fixed==0]) { # <-- selects the items I want to loop                                              #     through     my.data.it <- my.data[my.data$item!= j] # <-- this kicks item j out of the list     sum.data <-aggregate(my.data.it by=list(year) FUN=sum na.rm=TRUE) #<-- do an                                                                          # aggregation      do(a.little.dance) && make(a.little.love) -> get.down(tonight) # <-- a little                                                                    #  song and dance      delta <- (get.love)                                         # <-- get some love     delta.list<-append(delta.list delta after=length(delta.list)) #<-- put my love                                                                     #    in a vector  }  So obviously I hacked out a bunch of stuff in the middle just to make it less clumsy. The goal would be to remove the j loop using something more vector efficient.

28,592472,0,0,I always try to keep the browser from having to load and interpret CSS rules and JS code that isn't used on the HTML in question. I agree with @bobince that you should only break a page's styles and scripts into a separate file if it's necessary for organization but if your site is very big at all you will reach that point. However since I only build template based sites I am beginning to wonder why I link to external files at all. For example if I have a base template the things I put in the head of that template will be applied to all the pages on my site. So why not just put my styles and scripts there? Two reasons come to mind. First the browser can cache the external file and reuse it on every page that includes it without having to load it all over again. Second designers might not be as comfortable poking around in your templates as they are messing with plain CSS files.  That's all well and good for global styles that apply to every single page in your site but what about those one-off pages that have some style that isn't shared anywhere else? If you added this style to a globally applied external file you'd increase the initial load time of your site just to have a style that is only used on one page. Further when you go back to that file months later you will likely have forgotten what those rules were even for. I suggest that any style rule that is not expressed on every single page should be placed in ,1.0,2021-02-26,0,2023-08-10,NULL,22325.0,22325.0,591328,2,0.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

ETA: What I don't want is a new PSDrive for every archive I enter so the following isn't actually what I'm after: PS C:\Path> Invoke-Magic stuff.zip PS C:\Path> Set-Location MyNewDrive: PS MyNewDrive:> _  but rather PS C:\Path> Set-Location stuff.zip PS C:\Path\stuff.zip> _  ,0.0,2021-07-22,0,2023-08-10,NULL,64046.0,73070.0,0,1,1.0,<powershell><vfs><powershell-provider>,Is there a way in Powershell to provide virtual file systems in other file systems?,537.0
37,1217979,1218007,3,(Just to let you now I'm learning to develop for iPhone with a book I got called Beginning iPhone 3 Development: Exploring the SDK and I do not use Interface builder) Is there ever a reason to use the getter in the same class when a private member is visible? Like in Foo.h having NSObject *myObj; ... @property (nonatomic retain)NSObject *myObj;  and then in Foo.m accessing the member myObj using self.myObj (or [self myObj]) ? Because in my book Here is what it tells you to write in one of the apps (its checking if a UIViewController member's view is in the superview) : if(self.yellowViewController.view.superview == nil) {  (notice the self.yellowViewController...) Is there actually a reason for this? If there isn't one idea I have is maybe because the member blueViewController is of class BlueViewController so I think if there is no reason it may be to not cause confusion.

40,1261986,0,1,In my Powershell provider which is a business-logic layer over an SQL database the Powershell drives equate to database connection settings.  This collection of connection settings is persisted to an encrypted XML file on the local computer.  An administrator may add these PS drives on a computer supplying SQL Server credentials that another Powershell user may use when writing scripts.  When the administrator runs New-PSDrive I add a drive to the collection and persist it to the XML.  When they Remove-PSDrive I remove the drive from the persistent XML.  This works fine.  However when the Powershell host is exiting it calls RemoveDrive() for each existing drive.  At this point I do not want to remove the drives since I need them to persist on the computer. How do I determine if RemoveDrive() is being called from a user manually executing Remove-PSDrive or the host exiting? Also I have created custom drive info parameters which work well but I also wrote a custom cmdlet which is used to add and remove drives.

80,2978120,2980705,3,I was having a discussion with my friend the other day. I was saying how that in pure Lua you couldn't build a preemptive multitasking system. He claims you can because of the following reason:  Both C and Lua have no inbuilt threading libraries [OP's note: well Lua technically does but AFAIK it's not useful for our purposes]. Windows which is written in mostly C(++) has pre-emptive multitasking which they built from scratch. Therefore you should be able to do the same in Lua.  The big problem i see with that is that the main way preemptive multitasking works (to my knowledge) is that it generates regular interrupts which the manager uses to get control and determine what code it should be working on next. I also don't think Lua has any facility that can do that. My question is: is it possible to write a pure-Lua library that allows people to have pre-emptive multitasking?  ,1.0,2022-06-04,4,2023-08-10,NULL,317773.0,117069.0,0,1,9.0,<multithreading><lua><preemptive>,Multithreading in Lua,17031.0

Known/assumed issues: - innerHTML would be fast but the Elements would need to have a generated ID and be later retrieved later again via getElementByID; not the cleanest/fastest way. - Cloning the node putting it into an documentFragment doing all operations and replacing it back again would be good – but cloning does discard event handlers as far as I know.

This means that if you want a new 14-character array you end up with a whole new page to hold it say 8k. Most of the page is unused but you can detect errant accesses by watching which pages get used. I can imagine that on account of having so much extra space if a problem gets past the guards you wouldn't see an error.  If you don't have a bad access but rather corruption due to two threads not locking correctly efence won't detect it. efence also likely keeps pointers to allocated memory fooling valgrind into reporting no problems.

The only way you can get the file back into your app is if your app registers as an application that can open that document type. THEN you have to hope that the other application gives the user the option to open the new file in another application. Another option is to use a third party cloud service for storing the documents. Many apps integration with Dropbox now. If your app and DocsToGo both used Dropbox then you would be able to both edit the same document and get access to it.

Yes. In summary there is no good way and no easy way but if you really really want to it can be done.  Broadly speaking the program is compiled for debugging and you then open the image file at run-time and find out which variables exist and where they are stored. Most likely the practical way to accomplish this would be to script a debugger like gdb and let it do the low-level work.

153,5746559,5746827,3,I have a high-priority process that needs to pass data to a low-priority process. I've written a basic ring buffer to handle the passing of data: class RingBuffer {   public:     RingBuffer(int size);     ~RingBuffer();      int count() {return (size + end - start) % size;}      void write(char *data int bytes) {       // some work that uses only buffer and end       end = (end + bytes) % size;     }      void read(char *data int bytes) {       // some work that uses only buffer and start       start = (start + bytes) % size;     }    private:     char *buffer;     const int size;     int start end; };  Here's the problem. Suppose the low-priority process has an oracle that tells it exactly how much data needs to be read so that count() need never be called. Then (unless I'm missing something) there are no concurrency issues. However as soon as the low-priority thread needs to call count() (the high-priority thread might want to call it too to check if the buffer is too full) there is the possibility that the math in count() or the update to end is not atomic introducing a bug. I could put a mutex around the accesses to start and end but that would cause priority inversion if the high-priority thread has to wait for the lock acquired by the low-priority thread. I might be able to work something out using atomic operations but I'm not aware of a nice cross-platform library providing these.  Is there a standard ring-buffer design that avoids these issues? ,3.0,2023-04-21,3,2023-08-10,NULL,590042.0,168715.0,0,1,8.0,<c++><concurrency><circular-buffer>,ring buffer without priority inversion,1170.0

187,6832220,6841293,1,I'm trying to bind a list/arraylist/hashmap/etc of custom objects to my form in JSP using Spring. Right now the controller creates a Map of the two lists (Boolean list and custom object list) in referenceData() and provides it to the form which uses those values to populate the fields. The values are initialized from a MySQL database using Hibernate and all that works fine. The list is a known length before the form is initialized so that part is easier. Now what I'd like to do is correctly bind those objects in the form so that when there are changes made I can detect that in onSubmit() (or wherever is appropriate) and update the database accordingly. I can't seem to bind them correctly in the form so that I can see changes made. I tried just using a list of the form fields as the model but even that wasn't working correctly. Do I just need to inject the list in a particular way? Any ideas or examples here? Any help would be greatly appreciated. UPDATE: At Ralph's request here is the solution I used: In my data object class I lazy loaded a map using MapUtils.lazyMap() with a String key and other custom object value. The other custom object is just a class that contains List and getters/setters. In the corresponding .jsp file I just nest several loops to loop through the keys first using loop.current.key and then loop2.current.value.paramsList to loop through the values for that key. This was not really what I asked for in my original post as I was looking for a more general solution and the lazy loading pointed me in the right direction. ,3.0,2023-07-26,0,2023-08-10,NULL,483402.0,483402.0,0,1,0.0,<forms><spring><jsp><binding>,Spring List Binding in Form,572.0

195,6903533,6960139,5,Given two file trees A and B is it possible to determine the shortest sequence of operations or a short sequence of operations that is necessary in order to transform A to B? An operation can be:  Create a new empty folder Create a new file with any contents Delete a file Delete an empty folder Rename a file Rename a folder Move a file inside another existing folder Move a folder inside another existing folder  A and B are identical when they will have the same files with the same contents (or same size same CRC) and same name in the same folder structure. This question has been puzzling me for some time. For the moment I have the following basic idea:  Compute a database:  Store file names and their CRCs Then find all folders with no subfolders and compute a CRC from the CRCs of the files they contain and a size from the total size of the files they contain Ascend the tree to make a CRC for each parent folder  Use the following loop having database A and database B:  Compute A ∩ B and remove this intersection from both databases. Use an inner join to find matching CRCs in A and B folders first order by size desc while there is a result use the first result to make a folder or file move (possibly creating new folders if necessary) remove from both database the source rows of the result. If there was a move then update CRCs of new location's parent folders in db A. Then remove all files and folders referenced in database A and create those referenced in database B.   However I think that this is really a suboptimal way to do that. What could you give me as advice?

204,6941935,0,0,Ugh... this error sucks.  When you say that you inserted a row I assume that you inserted it at the publisher.  That's not going to work; replication delivers commands serially.  That is it won't replicate the fact that you inserted the missing row until it gets past your current error. So here's where we start.  In the error message we see an transaction sequence number.  We can use that to determine the primary key of the missing row.  At the distributor there's a stored procedure called sp_browsereplcmds.  You can plug in the transaction sequence number in for both the @xact_seqno_start and @xact_seqno_end parameters.  You'll also see a command_id parameter in the stored procedure; this corresponds to the Command ID in your error message.  Try executing the procedure with just those parameters specified.  It should give you the command that it's trying to execute at the subscriber.  From there you can tell the primary key of the row that it's either trying to update or delete.  You can then insert a row with that primary key at the subscriber and replication will move on. Alternatively you could drop this article from this subscriber re-add it and re-initialize that article.

215,6959868,0,0,Here is what you need to do in order to correctly merge the contexts. First you do not need your own notification. Performing a save operation on a context automatically forwards the following notification to registered observers: NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification  Therefore all you need to do is: 1) in your main thread may be in the viewDidLoad method register for this notification: [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self                                          selector:@selector(contextDidSave:)                                              name:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification                                             object:nil];  2) implement the contextDidSave: method in your main thread as follows: - (void)contextDidSave:(NSNotification *)notification {      SEL selector = @selector(mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:);      [managedObjectContext performSelectorOnMainThread:selector withObject:notification waitUntilDone:YES];  }  3) in your dealloc method add the following: [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];  4) create a new context in your other thread using something like the following method: - (NSManagedObjectContext*)createNewManagedObjectContext {      NSManagedObjectContext *moc = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init];      [moc setPersistentStoreCoordinator:[self persistentStoreCoordinator]];     [moc setUndoManager:nil];     return [moc autorelease]; }  5) upon receiving the new data the proper way to handle this situation is the use of managed object IDs. Since managed object IDs are thread safe you can pass them from your main thread to the other thread then use existingObjectWithID:error: to retrieve the object associated to a specific ID update it and save the context. Now the merge will operate as you expect. Alternatively if you do not know in advance what managed object IDs must be passed between the threads then in your other thread you simply fetch the objects using a predicate to retrieve the ones corresponding to the objects retrieved from the server then you update them and save the context. ,4.0,2023-08-05,0,2023-08-10,NULL,68814.0,68814.0,6959225,2,32.0,NULL,NULL,0.0
216,6939993,6940151,3,"""I'm currently dealing with a performance issue of graph implementation. Used technologies It is programmed in C++. For the moment the graph is implemented thanks to the BGL. About the graph The managed graph is dynamic and undirected. It has two kinds of structures: a lot of complete subgraphs and few of single edges. The only needed information is the direct neighborhood of a vertex. Problem statement At the beginning the complete subgraphs were small (about 10 vertices) and numerous (about 13k). An adjacency list implementation the BGL's one was perfect. But now it is asked to manage few subgraph of 5000 vertices. That means 5000x5000 edges. The performance in time and space are then very poor now. Rejected solutions My first thought was to use the adjacency matrix implementation provided by BGL. But it doesn't allow dynamic graph. To resolve this constraint two solutions: provide a new implementation of adjacency matrix for dynamic graph or use a pool of available vertices in a static graph. After reflection I think it's not a good idea: the space complexity is still VxV/2. Final Solution and question So here my final solution: don't use the BGL implement bags of vertices to represent complete subgraphs (no need of edges) and directly connect vertices for the few single edges. By doing so the space complexity of the biggest subgraph falls to its number of vertices about 5000.  Do you think this last solution is the good one? If not which implementation could I use? And why?  Update 1 More information about the graph: The graph has ~100k vertices ~13k complete subgraphs of about 3 vertices and ~100 complete subgraphs of size range [10-5000]. And each edge has bundled properties. Update 2 I've recently learned thanks to Salim Jouilli that the bag of nodes is a candid approach of hypergraph where a hyperedge consists in a subset of nodes.  Update 3 I've finished to implement the solution. I've effectively gain in memory consumption and runtime: from 6GB to 24MB and from 50min to 2min30.

245,7004288,0,0,Here's one solution which is not technically a factory but solves the same problem -- providing new objects when you change parameters: struct A {   int a;   float x;   int c; }; class ObjectCollection { public:     ObjectCollection() { m_a.c = 10; }     A &get_obj_a(int a float x)     {     m_a.a = a;     m_a.x = x;     return m_a;     } private:     A m_a; };  This version has advantage that it does not pass around ownership to the object but still you can create different kinds of objects with it. Two calls to get_obj_a() will cause problems though it only works if you call get_obj_a() immediately before you need the object. Now the if statement can be put inside the factory function. Also here's another way to do it: class DerivedFactory { public:    DerivedFactory(ObjectCollection1 &c ObjectCollection2 &c2) : c(c)c2(c2) { }    Base &get_obj_a_or_b(bool b) {          if (b) return c.get_obj_a(1011.0);          else return c2.get_obj_b(20.013.0);    }  private:   ObjectCollection1 &c   ObjectCollection2 &c2 };  ,0.0,2023-08-09,0,2023-08-10,NULL,813009.0,813009.0,7002066,2,0.0,NULL,NULL,0.0
246,7004394,0,0,Recommendations:  Don't mix Swing with AWT components -- so instead of a Canvas object use a JPanel. Override the JPanel's paintComponent method. Call the super.paintComponent method as the first line of paintComponent. Use a Swing Timer to do your animation and never put Thread.sleep in a paint or paintComponent method. In fact you should avoid using Thread.sleep anywhere in a Swing GUI unless you know how to handle concurrency in Swing. Never call repaint() in a paint or paintComponent method. You're lucky that the paint manager is smart enough not to allow that call lead to a recursion-induced stackoverflow error.  ,1.0,2023-08-09,0,2023-08-10,NULL,522444.0,522444.0,7004330,2,4.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

252,7008323,7008932,2,I'm writing a piece of software that will process huge amounts of data. For memory efficiency some of the fields in the records being processed are stored in a single bitmap. Using #defines I declared what both the position and the size of each field in the bitmap is. Now I need a fast way to check against predefined values. My first attempt was this: bool checkBit(unsigned short int a_bitMap unsigned short int a_bitValue unsigned short int a_bitPosition) {     // Values are always bit-0 based so we need to shift here     unsigned short int _value = (a_bitValue << a_bitPosition);     return ((a_bitMap & _value) == _value); }  Here a_bitMap is the bitmap for the record being processed holding data for all fields and a_bitValue is the (defined) coded value being checked (which would in case of flags always be 1). This works and is fast but this way I cannot use the value '0' as a coded value (so 3 bit give me only 7 options not 8) so I came up with this solution: bool checkBit(unsigned short int a_bitMap unsigned short int a_bitValue unsigned short int a_bitPosition unsigned short int a_bitSize) {     static const unsigned short int bitmapSize = 8 * sizeof(a_bitMap);     unsigned short int _shift = bitmapSize - (a_bitPosition + a_bitSize);     a_bitMap = (a_bitMap << _shift);     a_bitMap = (a_bitMap >> (a_bitPosition + _shift));     return (a_bitMap == a_bitValue); }  This works exactly the way I want... but it slows down the process dramatically. The number of records that need to be processed goes into the billions so these extra shifts have a huge impact. That's also why I'd like to avoid std::bitset since billions of object instantiations gives too much overhead as well. How can I do this while still being able to distinguish 0-values? ,4.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,860392.0,860392.0,0,1,0.0,<c++><c><bitmap><bit-manipulation>,Querying a bitmap distinguishing 0-values,98.0
253,7004543,0,0,Yes it's bad. Use a goto.  #define fail_unless(x) do {if(!(x)) goto fail;} while (0)   int foo()  {      fail_unless( my_write(...) );      fail_unless( bar() );      return 0;  fail:      cleanup();      return -1;  }  Edit: if you're downvoting because you don't understand what that while loop is doing there you should just have asked. It is a standard technique for making sure a C macro acts as a single statement in any context. If your macro expands to an if statement (like the macros in the other upvoted answers) then you get unexpected side effects eg:  #define DONT_DO_THIS(x) if (!x) { foo; }   if (a) DONT_DO_THIS(x)  else something_else();  You'd expect something_else to be executed when !a but what the macro actually expands to is:  if (a)      if (!x) { foo;}      else something_else();  And something_else is executed when a && x not when !a as the programmer intended. ,6.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,151238.0,151238.0,7004327,2,-4.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

268,7004499,0,0,First error: pointers and objects You need to call myfunc with a pointer to a SLD_Event object instead of calling with the SLD_Event object itself: myfunc(&event);  Putting a & in front of a object (or variable) tells the compiler that you want the memory address of the object (which is the so called pointer to it). Putting a * in front of a pointer to an object tells the compiler that you want the content of the memory address to which the pointer points (which is the object or variable itself) The compiler error you get tells that the compiler is not able to find a function with the name myfunc that accepts a (reference to) an SLD_Event object. Which is correct since the (only) myfunc function available requires a pointer to a SLD_Event object as its argument. Second error: pointers to pointers The second (independent to the first one) compiler error (error: cannot convert 'SDL_Event**' to 'SDL_Event*' for argument '1' to 'int SDL_PollEvent(SDL_Event*)') you got tells that the variable type you put into the SLD_PollEvent function is incompatible with the expected typeand it could not be converted automatically. Because you added a & before the event variable in that function call you are basically asking to get the pointer to the memory location which points the the event object. The is perfectly legal C code but not what you want because the SLD_EventPoll function expect the pointer the the event object (which has the type SLD_Event *). So to solve your second error change the line into: while ( SDL_PollEvent(event) ) {  (notice the removed &) Third error: Addressing object variables in (pointers to) objects The third error in your code is the event.type.

278,7008456,0,0,Interesting; the bcl.DateTime type is really intended to represent the internal DateTime format and is not really intended for use directly. I should probably correct that to interpret bcl.DateTime as DateTime during translation but the more typical usage here (since you are talking about .NET types such as DateTime) would be code-first i.e. [ProtoContract] class Test {     [ProtoMember(1 IsRequired = true)]     public DateTime AsOf {get;set;}   }  this should then work as desired for both protobuf and xs purposes. Do you need .proto here? I can patch that I just want to know if it is required.  Re the comment / update and re using .proto - I would strongly suggest using the most basic common format for the time value - possibly a long (or a string maybe) and either use shim properties in a partial class to expose a twin DateTime value to xs or (perhaps better) use a separate DTO to represent the protobuf / xs aspects and map between them.

283,7004695,0,0,"""The CPU will cache all the data it needs and because its size is limited when it has to load something new it will drop anything that was the least recently used. Basically you don't have direct control over it but indirectly you have some: What you have to know is that CPUs use cache lines. Each cache line is a small block of memory. So if the CPU needs some data it will fetch the whole block. So if you have some data that is very frequently used and would normally be scattered in the memory you can put it for example inside a struct so the the effective usage of the CPU cache will better (you cache less things that aren't really needed). Note: 99.99% of the time you don't need these kind of optimizations. A more useful example is walking through a 2d array that doesn't fit into cache. If you walk it linearly you will load each cache line once process it and some point later the CPU will drop it. If you use the indexes the wrong way each cache line will be loaded multiple times and because main memory access is slow your code will be a lot slower. CPU can also do better prefetching if you walk linearly (direction doesn't matter). Cache peformance can also be ruined by calling some external library which needs a lot of data and/or code so you main program+data will be dropped from the caches and when the call finishes the CPU has to load it again. If you do heavy optimizations and want to know how you utilize the L1/L2/.. cache you can do simulations. Valgrind has an excellent module called Cachegrind which does exactly that.

However the identifier my_var is not defined at that point so it fails. In the second example due to how javascript variable hoisting works the my_var variable is already declared when you read from it by assign to it.

It's MUCH easier to maintain business logic code than to store it all in the database. Sprocs Views and Functions can only go so far until you have Views of Views of Views with sprocs to fill that mess in. With business logic you separate your worries. If you have a bug that's causing something to be calculated wrong it's easier to check the business logic code than go into the DB and see if someone messed up something in a Stored Procedure. This is highly opinionated and in some cases it's OK to put some logic in the database but my thoughts on this are it's a database not a logicbase put things where they belong.

My opinion from reading various bits and pieces over the years is that ToString() has a rather weak contract i.e. override it (if you want) to display some meaningful stuff. See I said display there?  The code that I came across relied on the textual representation of instances of this type to be very specific;  adding anything other than what's expected would cause all sorts of problems.

Check the scope above (and the scope above that) until it finds my_var. Create my_var in the global scope when it's not found.*  *Step 3 has not yet happened when you try to assign a value to my_var.

I assume that the infinite for loop is at the end of your main processing loop. You don't need the infinite loop: _getch() will halt execution anyway until a key is pressed. In truth the fact that you've wrapped your conditional in a for loop is the reason that break isn't behaving like you want -- you're breaking out of the infinite loop but not your main processing loop. Example: while(1) {    // Do some processing    for (;;)    {       char temp;       temp = _getch();        if (temp == 'q')          break;   // This will break out of the for and continue the while    } }  vs. while(1) {    // Do some processing    if ('q' == _getch())       break;             // This will break out of the while }  You'll also notice that since _getch() returns a char you can just test the return code of the function (unless you need to store the input for later use). ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,265575.0,265575.0,7013021,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

Without it 136 might match [13579][26] for example.  Edit: to allow leading zeros change the pattern to: \b0{02}[048]\b|\b0?[13579][26]\b|\b0?[2468][048]\b|\b1[02][048]\b|\b11[26]\b (note that 0{02} could also be written as 0?0?). Edit 2: you might get rid of the \b if you split the ip address and only have a string containing the prefix/suffix. If you then call matches(...) you should be fine without the \b.

EDIT Changing the code to use for(int i =0 : i < array.size() ; i++) seems to solve this problem but I would still like to know /why/ it happens:     synchronized(tasks)     {         for(int i=0; i < tasks.size(); i++)             tasks.get(i).cancel(true);     }      synchronized(threads)     {         for(int i=0; i < threads.size(); i++)             threads.get(i).interrupt();     }  ,0.0,2023-08-10,1,2023-08-10,NULL,726954.0,726954.0,0,1,1.0,<android><multithreading>,Android - Keeping track of Threads,798.0

I'd also say that if you are expecting a large resultset then put the BULK COLLECT into a loop too to reduce your memory requirements. In an ideal world you'd pass the variables activationStartDate activationEndDate deActivationStartDate and deActivationEndDate into the cursor as cursor parameters to keep the cursor modular but that's up to you. ;-) Hope this helps...  Ollie. EDIT: In response to your question about using records to select * from the table you can declare an associative array based on the cursor columns for the example above if you wanted to select more than one column from EMPLOYEE then after the WITH clause you would select the named columns from EMPLOYEE you want and instead of: FirstNameListTable dbms_sql.varchar2_table;  declare the associative array type and variable as: TYPE main_cur_tabtype IS TABLE OF main_cur%ROWTYPE      INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER; main_cur_tab main_cur_tabtype;  This gives you a flexible array that will automatically hold the columns selected in your cursor (main_cur). You would collect the records into this array with the BULK COLLECT: OPEN main_cur; FETCH main_cur BULK COLLECT INTO main_cur_tab; CLOSE main_cur;  and loop through them with: FOR i IN main_cur_tab.FIRST .. main_cur_tab.LAST LOOP    etc.  as for returning your resultset to Java well I'm no java expert and you'll need to ask that in another forum or tag this question with the Java tag and hope a Java person picks it up and answers it for you. ,14.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,833890.0,833890.0,7007968,2,0.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

449,7013635,0,2,In C# I had do create my own dynamic memory management. For that reason I have created a static memory manager and a MappableObject. All object that should be dynamic mappable and unmappable from and to the harddisk implement this interface.  This memory management is only done for these large objects that have the ability to unmap/map the data from the harddisk. All other things use of course the regular GC. Everytime a MappableObject is allocated it asks for memory. If no memory is available that the MemoryManager unmaps some data dynamically to the harddisk to get more memory to make it possible to allocate a new MappableObject. A problem in my case is that I can have more than 100.000 MappableObject instances (scattered over a few files ~ 10-20 files) and everytime I have to run through a list of all objects if I need to unmap some data. Is there a way to get all allocated objects that are created in my current instance? In fact I don't know what's easier to keep my own list or to run through the objects (if possible)? How would you solve such things? Update The reason is that I have a large amount of data. About 100GB of data that I need to keep during my run. Therefore I need the references on the data and so the GC is not able to clean the memory. In fact C# manages the memory pretty well but in such memory exhausting applications the GC gets really bad. Of course I tried to use the MemoryFailPoint but this slows down my allocations tremendously and does not give correct results for whatever reason. I have also tried MemoryMappedFiles but since I have to access the data randomly it doesn't help. Also MemoryMappedFiles only allow to have ~5000 file handles (on my system) and this is not enough. ,8.0,2023-08-10,1,2023-08-10,NULL,688164.0,688164.0,0,1,2.0,<c#><.net>,Is there a Running Object Table in .NET,809.0

462,7005923,0,0,EDIT: I figured out the problem. It turns out that Wordpress has it's own function to add in slashes. As of Wordpress version 3.2.1 you can find function wp_magic_quotes() around line 530 of /wp-includes/load.php To fix the issue I commented out everything within the function (not the function itself so as to prevent a call to an undefined function). It's removed the issue of escaped quotes. I haven't done extensive testing but from what I understand this may break older Wordpress plug-ins so be careful. It will go from this: function wp_magic_quotes() {     // If already slashed strip.     if ( get_magic_quotes_gpc() ) {         $_GET    = stripslashes_deep( $_GET    );         $_POST   = stripslashes_deep( $_POST   );         $_COOKIE = stripslashes_deep( $_COOKIE );     }      // Escape with wpdb.     $_GET    = add_magic_quotes( $_GET    );     $_POST   = add_magic_quotes( $_POST   );     $_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes( $_COOKIE );     $_SERVER = add_magic_quotes( $_SERVER );      // Force REQUEST to be GET + POST.     $_REQUEST = array_merge( $_GET $_POST ); }  to this: function wp_magic_quotes() {     // If already slashed strip.     /*if ( get_magic_quotes_gpc() ) {         $_GET    = stripslashes_deep( $_GET    );         $_POST   = stripslashes_deep( $_POST   );         $_COOKIE = stripslashes_deep( $_COOKIE );     }      // Escape with wpdb.     $_GET    = add_magic_quotes( $_GET    );     $_POST   = add_magic_quotes( $_POST   );     $_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes( $_COOKIE );     $_SERVER = add_magic_quotes( $_SERVER );      // Force REQUEST to be GET + POST.     $_REQUEST = array_merge( $_GET $_POST );*/ }  ,2.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,337903.0,337903.0,6990734,2,4.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

So far I have a semi-workable solution using flash.sampler.getSamples to get the difference between the number of NewObjectSamples and DeleteObjectSamples which have the same id value. The test looks something like this: startSampling(); new Foo(); new Foo(); new Foo(); forceGC(); pauseSampling(); countAllocations(Foo); // returns 1 should return 0  The countAllocations() method gets the difference between the number of NewObjectSamples and DeleteObjectSamples for a specific class:     public static function countAllocations(type:Class):int     {         var count:int = 0;         var allocations:Dictionary = new Dictionary();         for each (var sample:Sample in getSamples()) {             if (sample is NewObjectSample) {                 var newObjectSample:NewObjectSample = sample as NewObjectSample;                 if ((newObjectSample.type == type) && (newObjectSample.object != null)) {                     allocations[newObjectSample.id] = true;                     count ++;                 }             }              else if (sample is DeleteObjectSample) {                 var deleteObjectSample:DeleteObjectSample = sample as DeleteObjectSample;                 if (allocations[deleteObjectSample.id])                      count --;             }         }         return count;     }  The forceGC() method uses the LocalConnection hack to force garbage collection: public static function forceGC():void {         try {             new LocalConnection().connect(""""bdebdd96-7bf8-407b-bec9-8336b2b0c329"""");             new LocalConnection().connect(""""bdebdd96-7bf8-407b-bec9-8336b2b0c329"""");         }         catch (error:Error) {         } }  Stepping through the code shows that: NewObjectSample Foo id=1 (count = 1) NewObjectSample Foo id=2 (count = 2) NewObjectSample Foo id=3 (count = 3) // NewObjectSamples related to the LocalConnection hack DeleteObjectSample id=2 (count = 2) DeleteObjectSample id=1 (count = 1) // Where's wally #3??

Many docs discuss about that the sampling rate is  too high such that it causes game programming to slow down the frame rate.  It's said that this is fixed in some android version.  Now I come up with the problem. I desired to develop a handwriting note app  which requires the touch event handling. I noticed that the touch event triggered (or to said captured in onTouch function) is not as frequently as I want. It seems only tens of touch events captured in onTouch() and the points are not enough to make a smooth handwriting.  Does anyone knows how to increase the sampling rate of the touch event? I wonder  whether this is a hardware issue or because of android framework may filter some of the  event. Any suggestion will be appreciated. Thanks....

The backticks capture the command's stdout; you need to redirect that command's stderr which means the redirection needs to be between the backticks. My first thought was to do this: pid=`/usr/local/bin/lsof | grep 16752 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' 2>/dev/null`  but that only redirects the stderr of the awk command.  You need to discard stderr of the entire pipeline: pid=`(/usr/local/bin/lsof | grep 16752 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}') 2>/dev/null`  But personally I prefer $(...) to backticks: pid=$((/usr/local/bin/lsof | grep 16752 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}') 2>/dev/null)  (Note that I'm only redirecting stderr not stdout; you need stdout for the variable assignment.) ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,7552.0,827263.0,7016508,2,0.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

There are many PHP frameworks that map URL's to specific php functions  AJAX is just an asynchronous way to access a URL and receive a response.

546,7014315,0,0,It looks like frmMain has no reference to the original frmFlashIntro. Your bit of code frmFlashIntro fi=new frmFlashIntro(); fi.Close();//checked with dispose also  will actually create a second frmFlashIntro so when you call fi.Close() you're actually closing the second form not the original.  Theoretically you should be able to add a property to your frmMain that's a reference to frmFlashIntro and then call Dispose on that so something like frmMain fm = new frmMain(); this.FormfrmMainRef = fm; fm.FormIntroRef = this; FormfrmMainRef.Show(); And then in the load event of frmMain add a call to FormIntroRef.close() Ok but all that aside I think the best way to solve this problem is to update the Program.cs file and then have something like frmFlashIntro flashIntro = new frmFlashIntro frmFlashIntro.ShowDialog(); frmMain mainForm = new frmMain() Application.Run(frmMain);  Oh and a second side note generally types begin with capital letters and instances of those types begin lowercase and the are camel cased.

For example: struct s {     int x;     int y; }  and I have allocated memory for 10 objects of that struct using malloc. So whenever I need to use only one of the object in a function I usually create (or is passed as argument) pointer and point it to the required object (My superior told me to avoid array indexing because it adds a calculation when accessing any member of the struct) But is this the right way? I understand that dereferencing is not as expensive as creating a copy but what if I'm dereferencing a number of times (like 20 to 30) in the function.  Would it be better if i created temporary variables for the struct variables (only the ones I need I certainly don't use all the members) and copy over the value and then set the actual struct's value before returning?

577,7014216,0,1,I receive an exported CSV file with several columns daily.  There are only three columns I am interested in and I presently have a script that extracts these three columns into a new file.  These three columns must be in a certain order before sending it to an outside vendor to continue the processing - ColumnA ColumnN and ColumnO (these each have their own unique name in the first line (header)).   The problem is the exported form is very inconsistent quite often ColumnN and ColumnP are reversed so that the script I am using will put the wrong data in the wrong position.  I am looking for a script that will allow me to order the columns based on the header name not on the column letter.  This way even if the exported file reverses these two columns they will still be in their proper position after my script extracts and orders them.  The exporting process is out of my hands and that particular vendor has told us that the inconsistency of the exported file will not change.  This process needs to be totally automated no interaction is possible.   ,2.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,92837.0,888312.0,0,1,1.0,<excel><sorting>,Reorder of csv file by header names,171.0

I am trying to download multiple files to one location on the users machine. They select these files from lists within a custom share-point web part. Thats the bit i have managed to get working! The downloading is done via WebClient (System.Net.WebClient) I now want to allow the user to select a location on their local machine to download the files to. I thought i would be able to use  but after attempting this i realized i can only pick files :( in order to get the desired location which will confuse the user I want something similar to the above but i only need it to return a path location like c:\Temp or any other location the user prefers on their local machine. Could anyone suggest a control that could provide this functionality. It can also be a share-point control.

679,7006989,0,0,You need to have PHP CLI (command line interface) to do this. It often comes with the PHP installation package (or a separate package). So as @James mentioned it you need to precede you script name with the CLI PHP executable which in windows is php.exe somewhere in your install directory. In UN*X systems it's somewhere in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or /opt/local/bin. If it is in the PATH you can simply execute it like this: php your_script.php  But keep in mind that running your script from server will be not the same as running from a webserver. For e.g. you won't have the POST or GET variables. So your script may not work. Update You can make the cron ran scripts unreachable for your webserver by making it unreadable by the user who is running the PHP scripts by the http daemon (usually www-data). I recommend to make it readable only by the user who is running it from cron: chown cronuser your_script.php chmod 0400 your_script.php  Update2 If you're running your script in cron with the same user as the webserver does then at the top of your script stop it from being executed: if (!(php_sapi_name() == 'cli' && empty($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']))) {   header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');   exit; }  ,2.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,221213.0,221213.0,7006885,2,2.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

You need to re-think your strategy and instead simply reference a Min or CoundownUserControl object.  What does each one represent?  You are suggesting that the UserControl (a part of a Form) needs to have its own Form created for it - that's not the case.  The Form is the object that creates the UserControl.  The UserControl can access the Form by using the ParentForm property. The StackOverflow When you do this: new Min() you are creating a new Min object.  Then in Min when you do this: new CountdownUserControl() you are creating a new CoundownUserControl object.  Which in turn creates a new Min object and so on and so forth. How to fix your problem Simply put use Min min = (Min)this.ParentForm; within the user control if you are sure the user control is on a Form whose type is Min. And finally/additionally you should not create the instance of CountdownUserControl yourself unless you are going to set the properties and add it to the Controls collection of the form within your code.  Instead build your project drag-and-drop the CountdownUserControl onto your form - a property to access the control will be created on your Min class automatically called countdownUserControl1. ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,376409.0,376409.0,7010612,2,3.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

So if you want to keep that reference you could go like var shuffle = (function() {     var deck = [];      return function(x) {         deck.push(x);          return deck;     }; }());  Now .shuffle() closes over the deck by returning another function. So it could look like var Placemat = function() {     var myDeck = shuffle(5);      shuffle(10);     shuffle(15);      var card1 = deck.shift();     var card2 = deck.shift(); }  Even if that is probably not the greatest way to go.

723,7017393,0,0,The best reason to run a repo manager is to achieve reliable behavior in the face of maven's treatment of  declarations. If any dependency you reference or plugin you use or dependency of a plugin you use declares any repositories maven will start searching for everything in those repositories. And if they are unreliable or slow there goes your build. While current policy is to forbid repository declarations in central there are plenty of historical poms pointing every-which way. The only cure for this is to set up a repository manager and declare it to be a 'mirrorOf' '*' in settings.xml. Then put the necessary rules in your repository manager to search only the places you want to search. Of course if there are more than one of you and you want to share snapshots or releases you'll really want a repo manager too. That's the obvious reason. If I turn off my repo manager and just try to build some of my projects that have the bad luck to have plugin/dependencies with repository declarations in their poms they fail. With the repo manager all is well. ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,217324.0,131433.0,7017215,2,5.0,NULL,NULL,0.0
724,7007152,0,0,free returns the memory to the system. It is the partner operation to malloc. Everything block of memory that you allocate with malloc should be returned to the system by calling free. After you call free you are no longer allowed to access that memory. It's generally considered wise to set the pointer to NULL after you have called free at least in debug builds so that you can be sure that an error will be raised if you later attempt to dereference the pointer by mistake.  So why can you still access memory that has been freed?  Well you can't reliably do so. It just so happens that the implementation of most memory management systems mean that you can sometimes get away with such abuses. Many memory managers allocate large blocks of memory from the operating systems and then in turn allocate small sub-blocks to the application. When you call free the allocator returns that block back to its pool of readily available memory but does not necessarily give the memory back to the OS since OS memory allocation routines are typically expensive. Hence accessing it may still appear to work because the memory is still allocated in your process. It's just that its now owned by the memory manager rather than by your app. Something like that is happening to you here. Of course sometimes you won't get away with abuses like this most likely once you have deployed your software onto your most important client's machine! ,6.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,505088.0,505088.0,7007133,2,3.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

761,7017352,7017497,2,Update I've updated this question to include source code of a Java implementation using the suggested SwingWorker class to accomplish the same result as the Objective-C example. Hopefully this will be of aid to future adventurers. Document myDoc = ...; Model myModel = ...;  SwingWorker analyzeDocument = new SwingWorker() {     @Override     public Dictionary doInBackground() {         return myDoc.analyze();     }      @Override     public void done() {         try {             stats = get();             myModel.setDict(stats);             myModel.setNeedsDisplay(true);         } catch(InterruptedException ex) {             // log         } catch(ExecutionException ex) {             // log         }     } };  analyzeDocument.execute();  Original Post I'm inexperienced when it comes to concurrent programming and I was hoping someone may be able to explain to me how I can achieve this. In Objective-C (with GCD) you're able to do something like this:  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT NULL) ^{      NSDictionary *stats = [myDoc analyze];      dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue() ^{        [myModel setDict:stats];        [myStatsView setNeedsDisplay:YES];        [stats release];      });  });  This code will execute [myDoc analyze] in the background thread following a callback function to update the UI which will executed in the main thread. In other words the background thread sends an interrupt to the main thread adding the anonymous function to the main thread's queue to be invoked. Obviously I won't be able to use anonymous functions in Java but that's beside the point. I am interested in doing something to this effect in Java. I have a Runnable object which does a bunch of stuff in the file system. When it finishes I want to update the UI accordingly. In an effort to not hang the main thread while doing this (ie: backgroundThread.join();) I've set the background thread to execute a callback function to update the UI. But this isn't a good idea I don't want a non-GUI thread updating the GUI. Some other ideas I've thought of is polling but that seems like throwing cycles out the window. By the same judgement using Futures doesn't seem to be the answer either. This all seems to defeat the purpose of an asynchronous action. The only other thing I can think of is using SwingUtilities.invokeLater from the background thread and using it to update the GUI. But I'm curious in which thread this would be executed. Maybe my perception is just warped but this seems like it would be a pretty big part to leave out. Am I just trying to go about this the wrong way? ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,84328.0,84328.0,0,1,4.0,<java><swing><concurrency><swingworker><runnable>,Invoke function on main thread from background thread,1760.0

To be more clear: T1(idc1c2) - c1 and c2 are from either T2 or T3 T2(idname) T3(idname) Consider T2 and T3 have to be different tables. And if c1 is from T1 (for example) c2 can be from either T2 or T3. Should I: 1. Create a new table that holds the associations and have c1 and c2 point to an id from that table? i.e. T4(idid_from_T1id_from_T2_or_T3what_table) 2.

786,7017583,7017696,9,I have a Service class with a method called GetProducts(). That encapsulates business logic and calls the repository to get a list of products. My MVC view wants to show that list of products as an MVC SelectList. Where is the correct place for that logic to go. I seem to have 3 options:  Model The Model should expose a property called ProductSelectList. When the getter of this property is called by the View the Model should call Service.GetProducts() and convert the result to a SelectList before passing it on.  Plausible argument: The Model should make calls to business logic and the repository. The View should merely render predetermined data. The Controller should not be involved save for passing contextual data to the Model. View The View should contain code that calls Service.GetProducts() directly and converts the result to a SelectList inline. Plausible argument: The View should call for this data directly as it is specifically for use on the View. There is no need to involve the Model or Controller as we are calling an abstracted Service method anyway so anything else just adds extra overhead. Controller The Controller should make the call to Service.GetProducts() convert the results to a SelectList and pass it through to the Model which should contain a simple ProductSelectList property. The View will access this property for rendering. Plausible argument: The Controller knows which parameters to provide to the Service method so it should make the call. The Model should be a simple placeholder for data filled by the Controller. The View's job is to simply render the data from the Model.  I have a feeling that the correct answer is Model but the other two make some reasonable points. Perhaps I've muddied the waters by already having a Service class that's separate to the Model?

803,7007282,0,0,First off you couldn't do stuff like that in your post in a strict typed language like Java. Java code doesn't compile if you call non-static stuff in a static context. PHP is not that strict on these things (yet) but still you shouldn't do things just because you can although it's bad practice and in some languages even 'incorrect' practice. There sure are advantages using static methods. And it's not quite right that you gain nothing or even lose flexibility. Let's have an example: class A {    private static $prop_a = 'property_a';    public static function b() {     echo 'called b()';     echo self::$prop_a;      $A = new A();     $A->c();   }    public function c() {     echo 'called c()';   } }  Now we can call the class this way: A::b();  which outputs  called_b property_a called_c  But you can do the same with: $a = new A(); $a->b(); $a->c();  c() is executed twice now but you get the idea. Within your class you can instanciate the class itself and work with it like with a regular object. But from outside it's simply one line of code while it's 3 lines using the non-static way. Pretty cool huh?  And as you see you can use the static function in a non-static context which means you can declare your method static but if you instanciate your class you can simply call it like a regular method. Sounds pretty flexible to me ;) And no you can't use $this in a static context but that's what self is for ;) ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,690897.0,690897.0,7006946,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

Each service has its own domain. f.e.   a.company.com   b.company.com c.company.com  They written by different people so integration into single application problematic. My aim is to make nodejs routing of different requests to these different services based on hostname mentioned in GET/POST request. I know that I can use NGINX for such kind of routing but I'm sure it will slowdown whole solution. I still plan to keep speed of 2K Req/s. So I prefer to stay in nice Async world of nodejs.

823,7017605,7019537,2,I have some general questions about encapsulation as it relates to maintainability.  Here is an example class that I used to assist in the construction of a parse tree. (I have avoided STL for education's sake.) The Node class describes a node in a tree.  The managing class ParseTree (not shown) is responsible for building and maintaining the collection of Node objects in a meaningful tree-like way. // contents of node.h not including header guard or namespace class Token; class Node { public:   static const Node* FindParent(const Node* p_root const Node* p_node);   static int Height(const Node* p_root);   static void Print(const Node* p_root);   Node(const Token * p_tok=0) : p_left_(0) p_right_(0) p_tok_(p_tok) {}   ~Node() { delete p_left_; delete p_right_; }   const Node* p_left(void) const { return p_left_; }   const Node* p_right(void) const { return p_right_; }   const Token* p_tok(void) const { return p_tok_; } private:   friend class ParseTree;   Node* p_left_;   Node* p_right_;   Token* p_tok_; };  The following four topics relate to encapsulation.  The static methods in the Node class are declared static because they can be phrased without using any private members. I'm wondering if they should live outside Node in a common namespace or maybe as static members within ParseTree.  Should my decision be dominated by the fact that ParseTree is responsible for trees and by that logic the functions should live in ParseTree? On a related note the reason the static methods are in Node instead of ParseTree was because ParseTree was filling up with lots of members. I've read that keeping class small and agile is better for maintainability.  Should I be going out of my way to find methods that don't rely on private member access and pull them out of my class definition and put them into functions grouped within the same namespace as the class?    I had also read some advice about avoiding mutators on private members since it tends to break encapsulation so I ended up only having accessors and let ParseTree handle any modifications using its friendship with Node.  Is this really better than having mutators and just ending the friendship with ParseTree?  If I add mutators then Node can be reused in other contexts without adding another friendship.   If I add mutators and remove the static functions from Node I feel like I could just make the data members public and remove all the accessors/mutators/friend declarations.  I have the impression that such an approach would be bad form.  Should I be skeptical of my design if I have accessor/mutator pairs for each private member? If there's anything else obvious and wrong about my approach that I didn't think to ask I'd appreciate hearing about it.  ,3.0,2023-08-10,1,2023-08-10,NULL,438267.0,881639.0,0,1,2.0,<c++><data-structures><coding-style><encapsulation>,Structuring C++ class hierarchies for maintainability and encapsulation,278.0

853,6999460,6999554,1,I have n elements in a set U (lets assume represented by an array of size n). I want to find all possible ways of dividing the set U into two sets A and B where |A| + |B| = n. So for example if U = {abcd} the combinations would be:  A = {a}     -- B = {bcd} A = {b}     -- B = {acd} A = {c}     -- B = {abd} A = {d}     -- B = {abc} A = {ab}   -- B = {cd} A = {ac}   -- B = {bd} A = {ad}   -- B = {bc}  Note that the following two cases are considered equal and only one should be computed: Case 1: A = {ab} -- B = {cd} Case 2: A = {cd} -- B = {ab} Also note that none of the sets A or B can be empty. The way I'm thinking of implementing it is by just keeping track of indices in the array and moving them step by step. The number of indices will be equal to the number of elements in the set A and set B will contain all the remaining un-indexed elements. I was wondering if anyone knew of a better implementation. Im looking for better efficiency because this code will be executed on a fairly large set of data.

911,7011738,0,0,I would as the first answer suggest read the file with an InputStream. Converting from byte to char and back again is unnecessary and a source of error. Also verify that the input file really is using the ISO-8859-1 encoding. UPDATE: When using a FileReader you accept the default encoding (i.e. how to make chars from bytes). This encoding must match the encoding used for the input file otherwise there's a great risk that the result is corrupted.

In your second example there's no reason to read the file as characters since it will be sent on the wire as bytes anyway.

919,7011858,7987502,1,Matlab is failing to read in the specified number of elements from a file.  I have a simple program that needs to read in two files perform a linear operation on the data and write a combined result to a third file. My questions are: 1) Why does Matlab fail to read the specified number of elements and 2) is there a workaround for this? Any of your thoughts will be helpful. Some details on the input files:  they are large (~18GB) they are both the same size (exactly)  Details on the procedure (2-4 are conditioned on an feof check of both files:  Open the input and output files for reading and writing (resp.) Read in N floats (N*4 bytes) from each of the input files Perform an operation on the data (say 0.5*(datin1+datin2)) Write the result to the output file.    Granted this is all very simple and in most cases in the past this has worked well.  Unfortunately at some point in the cycle MATLAB doesn't get all N floats from one of the files and gives a matrix dimension error on step 3.   CODE SNIP: N = 2048; fidin1 = fopen('file1.dat''r''l'); fidin2 = fopen('file2.dat''r''l'); fidout = fopen('outfile.dat''w''l');  %# I could do some assertions on the file sizes %# but I know they are the same size (w/o question).  while(~feof(fidin1) && ~feof(fidin2))     datin1 = fread(fidin1N'float=>single'0'l');     datin2 = fread(fidin2N'float=>single'0'l');      %# the following line produces an error after 100      %# or more iterations in to the procedure     datout = 0.5*(datin1+datin2);     fwrite(fidoutdatout'float'0'l'); end  UPDATE 1 The error message I'm receiving is: ???Error using ==> plus Matrix dimension must agree.  UPDATE 2 I followed a suggestion and included ferrorchecks after each read and magically the problem went away.  So now a modification to my questions: What could be the root of the problem here?  Is this simply a timing issue or bug? Here is a snip of the updated code (showing only a portion of the code).  I'm sure there are better ways to do this.  Regardless the addition of these checks allowed Matlab to complete all the reads from each of the files successfully.     [datin1 count1]= fread(fidin1N'float=>single'0'l');     [msg errn1]=ferror(fidin1);     if errn1         pos1 = ftell(fidin1);         error('Error at Position %d in file.  %d bytes were read.'...             pos1count1);     end      [datin2 count2]= fread(fidin2N'float=>single'0'l');     [msg errn2]=ferror(fidin2);     if errn2         pos2 = ftell(fidin2);         error('Error at Position %d in file.  %d bytes were read.'...             pos2count2);     end      %# the following line produces an error after 100      %# or more iterations in to the procedure     datout = 0.5*(datin1+datin2);     fwrite(fidoutdatout'float'0'l');  ,11.0,2023-08-10,1,2023-08-10,NULL,845744.0,845744.0,0,1,7.0,<matlab><file-io>,Why is MATLAB failing to successfully read in binary files?,1602.0

Then put in a loop to write each line to the console. Then figure out how to split the line into individual numbers (hint strtok) Then figure out how to convert the numbers from the file (which are strings) to integers (hint prefer strtol over atoi) Then declare a large array and stick the numbers into it.

The situation would be somewhat different if load were a macro rather than a function—but even then standard R5RS macros are hygienic and cannot easily mess with the lexical context. However you could write a defmacro-style macro that does what you ask for by reading a file and returning a begin form containing everything read from the file. Example code: (define-macro (include file)   (let ((read-forms          (lambda ()            (let loop ((forms '()))              (let ((form (read)))                (if (eof-object? form)                    (reverse forms)                    (loop (cons form forms))))))))     (with-input-from-file file       (lambda ()         (cons 'begin (read-forms))))))  Note that define-macro is non-standard.

962,7003860,0,0, Use plain lists. They are heavily optimized. Using Data.Vector is even faster. Use rem instead of mod Avoid unnecessary work. (see cycleShift. Before you splitted the list twice) Use Int instead of Integer if your calculation may not exceed the bounds. The former is a hardware int while the later is arbitrary precision but emulated via software.  Result: 3.6 secs to 0.5 secs. More is probably possible. Code: import Data.List (foldl') import Data.Tuple  seqSize numShifts :: Int seqSize = 100  numShifts = 10000   cycleShift :: Int -> [a] -> [a] cycleShift s = uncurry (++) . swap . splitAt s  modAdd :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int] modAdd = zipWith (\ a b -> (a + b) `rem` 10^16)  step :: [Int] -> Int -> [Int] step l shift = modAdd l (cycleShift shift l)  allshifts = map (`rem` seqSize) [1..numShifts] start = 1 : replicate (seqSize - 1) 0 end = foldl' step start allshifts  main :: IO () main = print (head end)  Edit It gets even faster by using Data.Vector. I get around 0.4 sec on my machine using this code: import Data.List (foldl') import Data.Tuple  import Data.Vector (Vector) import qualified Data.Vector as V  seqSize numShifts :: Int seqSize = 100  numShifts = 10000   cycleShift :: Int -> Vector a -> Vector a cycleShift s = uncurry (V.++) . swap . V.splitAt s  modAdd :: Vector Int -> Vector Int -> Vector Int modAdd = V.zipWith (\ a b -> (a + b) `rem` 10^16)  step :: Vector Int -> Int -> Vector Int step l shift = modAdd l (cycleShift shift l)  allshifts = map (`rem` seqSize) [1..numShifts] start = 1 `V.cons` V.replicate (seqSize - 1) 0 end = foldl' step start allshifts  main :: IO () main = print (V.head end)  Edit 2 Using Data.Vector.Unboxed (Just change the imports and fix up the signatures) the runtime drops down to 0.074 secs.

971,7018175,7018339,2,I figured this must be a common question but I surprisingly couldn't find an answer so maybe my entire structure is terribad... I have an activity which downloads values/states of a game from a web service via AsyncTask. These values are used to update a custom view. Once the view is created various events from the view launch an AsyncTask to download other information. This is functional but the problem is I now have half a dozen AsyncTask classes in the activity with almost identical code. The only difference is the type of object that is returned (which is based on the json from the web service) and the method that is called from onPostExecute().  How can I use just two AsyncTask (one for post and one for get) without knowing what type of json object will be returned by the web service? In a similar vein how can I determine the type of object returned by the web service? The web service if there is a problem will return a json string that correlates to an ErrorMessage object rather than (for example) a GameData object.  Should I be using switch and instanceof in onPostExecute() somehow? Callbacks maybe? ,1.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,426429.0,686276.0,0,1,3.0,<java><android><json><android-asynctask><return-type>,How to Return Different Objects via Asynctask in Android,3851.0

976,7018237,0,0,If you want to validate two separate objects and avoid duplicating code then I think you may be in for an answer you won't want to hear. The only exception I can think of is to take the returned view model (unvalidated) and populate your models as you would if you were to perform the database action then do the validation check there. If there are errors bring those back to the ModelState dictionary and return the view to the browser with errors. This approach has the big side effect that you'd lose the client-side integration or at best - it'd involve a lot of AJAX calls to the server side. Personally I'd accept defeat and accept that you're going to have duplication of effort and just ensure that as much of your code is re-usable (e.g. as Data Annotation attributes that can be placed on both your view models and business models.  Checks in your view models should ensure that the information provided is correct e.g:   Its not empty. Its a valid email address The email address hasn't already been used The value entered matched the value of the 'confirm email' box.  Checks within your business models check to see that the data is correct. e.g.  Its not empty. Its length is less than the maximum length.   However with the business logic if you're concerned that the data may get polluted by inconcistent checks by alternative interfaces (or your forgetfulness) then duplicate some of the methods into the business logic or into the model metadata too. ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,7828.0,7828.0,7018006,2,0.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

It marks a time at which something should be executed and lets the main thread forget about it completely until that time arrives. sleep on the other hand is basically a no-op loop which lets nothing else execute while it's looping. This is important since the use cases for PHP and Javascript are entirely different. A PHP script has a start and an end and it executes in a linear fashion. Javascript is used for interactivity which means it needs to respond to various things (mouse clicks keyboard input timers AJAX callbacks) in a non-linear fashion as they happen.

It seems this is likely to require convariance/contravariance and therefore .Net 4 so to prevent the question being impossible feel free to answer for .Net4 though I would prefer a simple refactoring if it's available. This should be simple but for some reason my brain just isn't up to the (any?) challenge this morning. I have 2 applications (A & B).  Details of application A hopefully aren'y important so the following is WRT AppB which has 3 projects all class libraries:  Exposes my Domain Entities to the rest of AppB and is also exposed to AppA Exposes my Data Model to AppB only (uses L2S normal context and entities) Exposes functionality to AppA using the Domain Entities for parameters/return types  I have the following interfaces in the 3 different projects: In Project 1 (Domain Entities) VB: Public Interface IAppB_Project1_Contract(Of TKey)      ReadOnly Property UniqueReference As TKey End Interface  C# public interface IAppB_Project1_Contract {     TKey UniqueReference { get; } }  In Project 2 (Data Model) VB: Public Interface IAppB_Project2_Contract(Of TKey)      Inherits IAppB_Project1_Contract(Of TKey) End Interface  C#: public interface IAppB_Project2_Contract : IAppB_Project1_Contract { }  In Project 3 (Functionality) VB: Public Interface IAppB_Project3_Contract      Function Create(Of T As {Class IAppB_Project1_Contract(Of TKey)} TKey)(ByVal entity As T) As TKey End Interface  C#: public interface IAppB_Project3_Contract {     TKey Create(T entity) where T : class IAppB_Project1_Contract; }  The idea was that the functionality contracts (in Project 3) would only use Domain Entities (in Project 1) as arguments/returns because only Projects 1 and 3 are exposed to Application A Project 2 is not. My L2S entities are extended to implement the Project 2 Interface.  There are actually several additional methods on Project 2's contract but hopefully not relevant. Until I actually typed it for some reason I had it in my head that I would get away with the following implementation of Project 3's contract: VB: Public Class Project3_Implementation     Implements IAppB_Project3_Contract      Public Function Create(Of T As {Class IApp_Project2_Contract(Of TKey)} TKey)(ByVal entity As T) As TKey Implements IAppB_Project3_Contract.Create         ' notice the very subtle change to *Project TWO's* contract in the generics' constraint     End Function End Class  C#: public class Project3_Implementation : IAppB_Project3_Contract {     public TKey Create(T entity) where T : class IApp_Project2_Contract     {         // notice the very subtle change to *Project TWO's* contract in the generics' constraint     } }  This worked in my head for a while because Project 2's contract inherits Project 1's but this of course is not the case because I have narrowed the constraint which therefore cannot implement the corresponding project 3 interface. The question is how would I go about achieving what I sought:  Project 2 should remain invisible to Application A Project 1 and 3 however are exposed and should describe the functionality available and the entities to which Application A can/must use in order to call Application B The Implementation of Project 3's contract ideally constrains the parameters to actually being the entities declared in the hidden project 2.  I've got a feeling I'm asking the impossible but I'm hoping someone outside the box looking in can suggest something I can change to achieve or come close to achieving my goals? Thanks in advance!! EDIT: I knew the question wouldn't be clear because what I've described in the question is simply how to do something wrong... Here's more details on the implementation of Project 3's contract which hopefully makes things more clear (bearing in mind that Project 2's contract is only implemented by auto-generated Linq Entities): VB: Public Class MyImplementation     Inherits System.Data.Linq.DataContext     Implements IAppB_Project3_Contract      Public Function Create(Of T As {Class IApp_Project2_Contract(Of TKey)} TKey)(ByVal entity As T) As TKey Implements IAppB_Project3_Contract.Create         Me.GetTable(Of T).InsertOnSubmit(entity)         Return entity.UniqueReference        ' the entity will implement the IApp_Project2_Contract by exposings it primary key - Return Me.MyPrimaryKeyField     End Function End Class  C#: public class MyImplementation : System.Data.Linq.DataContext IAppB_Project3_Contract {     public TKey Create(T entity) where T : class IApp_Project2_Contract     {         this.GetTable.InsertOnSubmit(entity);         return entity.UniqueReference;         // the entity will implement the IApp_Project2_Contract by exposings it primary key - Return Me.MyPrimaryKeyField     } }  ,9.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,707618.0,707618.0,0,1,0.0,<c#><vb.net><inheritance><interface>,Refactoring to get inheritance/interfaces/convariance correct,145.0

1012,7012124,0,0,I think it is as simple as this. The ViewScript cannot be used in the init() method for your form for one simple reason. If you look at the example (and probably your display.phtml) there are echo statements like this one $this->form->firstname;. At this point in init() the form elements are not loaded yet! The author therefore correctly shows this code $form->setDecorators(array(     array('ViewScript' array('script' => 'demogForm.phtml')) ));  Note that he uses $form as the object. Either in controller or view script you load your form as an object and then add the ViewScript. So in one of your controllers you would do something like this $form = new My_Form(); $scriptPath = '/path/to/script/display.pthml' // or without a path if you have a script folder loaded $form->setDecorators(array(     array('ViewScript' array('script' => $scriptPath)) ));  This should do the trick. Update Looking at the naming of your pthml I assume (and hope) this is a special template for your form and not your whole layout file. If you use your whole layout file then of course if will render the whole page! ,2.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,550180.0,550180.0,7004703,2,2.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

EDIT some description: The application itself works like a check-in system for members in a club. Every time a member logs in or out it will be registered in the DB. In order for the app to be useful it has to show who are online on any given time of the day. So my query is getting all the logins for the day and if the recent activity is login then it will be outputted to the app. All that works like a charm but it's not that user friendly if they have to wait multiple seconds in order to see who is online and who is not. Hope that clears my objective a little. :) ,1.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,428343.0,428343.0,0,1,2.0,<mysql><sql>,Problem with sql query speed,102.0

1038,7000082,7000451,2,We have a set of locations within our product where BigInteger is required as the numbers can be fairly long. However in over 90% of the cases they are actually not that long and can be easily contained with-in a long. Looking at BigInteger's implementation it would be quite a waste to use BigInteger where Long is sufficient. Would it make sense to create an Interface that has functions like BigInteger (divide multiply etc.) and that would be implemented by a child class of BigInteger and a class that wraps Long? Something like: Interface: EfficientBigInteger Class 1: MyBigInteger extends BigInteger imlpements EfficientBigInteger Class 2: MyLong implements EfficientBigInteger (this will contain a Long as we cannot extend the Long class)  Maybe we're in the wrong direction here? Thanks Yon UPDATE: These objects (Long or BigInteger) are stored in memory for quite a while as they help us identify problematic behaviors of systems we interact with. Therefore the memory footprint could be a problem. This is the problem we're trying to avoid. The BigInteger class has several fields (signum mag array bitcount etc. etc.) which together are roughly double that of a class that encapsulates Long (taking into account the memory costs of having an Object in the first place). It means double the footprint for something we use a lot of. ,6.0,2023-08-09,0,2023-08-10,NULL,241684.0,241684.0,0,1,7.0,<java><biginteger>,Efficient BigInteger in Java,4442.0

1075,7018588,0,0,This is an instance of the common code reuse technique to implement one operator in terms of another. Suppose we have already defined a compound-plus operator: class X {   X & operator+=(const X&); };  This unary operator allows us to write a += b it modifies a and returns a reference to itself. This is all fine and good. Now if we also want to provide a copying binary plus opearator a + b which returns a the new value by value and leaves both a and b unchanged then we want to take advantage of the code we've already written for the compound operator. We do so by calling the unary operator on a temporary copy of a: X X::operator+(const X & b) const { return X(*this) += b; }                                            ^^^^^^^^                                            temporary copy  This is exactly what your code does only a bit more verbosely. You could as well have written return MyString(*this) += str; There are other idioms with follow a similar spirit such as implementing non-const access in terms of const access copy-assign in terms of copy-construct and swap and move-assign in terms of move-construct and swap.

1077,7018618,7018663,3,I'm writing a library that has a bunch of classes in it which are intended to be used by multiple frontends (some frontends share the same classes). For each frontend I am keeping a hand edited list of which classes (of a particular namespace) it uses. If the frontend tries to use a class that is not in this list there will be runtime errors. My goal is to move these errors to compile time. If any of you are curious these are 'mapped' nhibernate classes. I'm trying to restrict which frontend can use what so that there is less spin up time and just for my own sanity. There's going to be hundreds of these things eventually and it will be really nice if there's a list somewhere that tells me which frontends use what that I'm forced to maintain. I can't seem to get away with making subclasses to be used by each frontend and I can't use any wrapper classes... just take that as a given please! Ideally I want visual studio to underline red the offending classes if someone dares to try and use them with a nice custom error in the errors window. I also want them GONE from the intellisense windows. Is it possible to customize a project to do these things?

1103,7016622,0,0,That is how C compiler rolls. Objective-C is a super thin layer on top of C so knowing how your C works is good. All expressions are evaluated according to operator precedence and types are never promoted or demoted until the last minute. This is how C can ensure as correct results as possible. So the evaluation steps for this: float result = 1.0 + 1/2;  Is really:  (float)result = (double)1.0 + (int)((int)1 / (int)2); (float)result = (double)1.0 + (int)0; (float)result = (double)1.0 + (double)0.0; (float)result = (double)1.0; (float)result = (float)1.0;  What you want is this expression: float result = 1.0f + 1.0f/2.0f;  Then you end up with this evaluation:  (float)result = (float)1.0 + (float)((float)1.0 / (float)2); (float)result = (float)1.0 + (float)0.5; (float)result = (float)1.5;  Much less work for the CPU and you get what you expect. The speed boost is only noticeable if you use actual variables not constants. In reality your original statement and my revised statements will be optimized by the compiler as:  (float)result = (float)1; (float)result = (float)1.5;?  ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,165059.0,165059.0,7016114,2,3.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

I was thinking of using sand wood and rocks which are easy to get. and place them on a plastic surface. After taking a pic I'll apply some histogram to get the color and using this color I'll identify the material. But since the lightning conditions will change over time when i take this photograph and apply the histogram the color will change and the material won't be recognized properly. And I thought what if I were to use sand and dust they have very similar color but different texture is there something that can help me with that?

You lose type-safety IntelliSense and readability. You could also use non-generic container classes such as ArrayList. But then you're back to casting which is why we got generics in the first place. Personally I'd create the class.

Also it seems you are doing the inverse of what you intend you wish new to be populated with untested users not tested ones. This is that function with the errors corrected: def test_users(users):    new = list()    for u in users:       if not user_crawled(u):          new.append(u)    return new  Using a generator function you can further simplify the function (provided you intend on looping over the results): def test_users(users):    for u in users:       if not user_crawled(u):          yield u  You can also use the filter function: def test_users(users):    return filter(lambda u: not user_crawled(u) users)  Your using a list to store users not a hash-based structure.  Python provides sets for when you need a list-like structure which can never have duplicates and requires fast existence tests.  Sets can also be subtracted to remove all the elements in one set from the other. Also your list (U) is of users but you are matching it against user names.  You need to store just the user name of each added user.  Also you are using u to represent a user at one point in the program and to represent a user name at another you should use more meaningful variable names.

1149,6983719,0,0,I think that the problem is that GDI (without the +) does not support alpha transparency very well. At best it keeps the alpha channel untouched. When you build a Graphics object using a HDC with a selected bitmap that has an alpha channel... well things get mixed badly. My guess is that the GDI+ font rasterized decides which method to use to render based on a lot of parameters; then if this method happens to be supported in GDI it will be used (and the alpha channel ignored); if the render method is not supported in GDI it will fallback to a pixel-by-pixel render or similar and the alpha channel will be used correctly. So to get the correct results you should not use the HDC to modify the alpha channel. Try the following changes:  Use the bitmap to create the Graphics object not the HDC: Graphics oGraph( &oDaBigOne );  Select the bitmap into the HDC hOff only after the render has been done. To be sure it is better that the Graphics object is destroyed limiting its scope with { ... }.  [EDIT] After the new code the solution is easy: not only should you move the call to SelectObject() after the drawing also the GetBitmap(). That is these two functions shoul be just before the call to :UpdateLayeredWindow(): oDaBigOne.GetHBITMAP( oCol &hBMit ); HGDIOBJ hSave = ::SelectObject( hOff hBMit );  ,7.0,2023-08-08,0,2023-08-10,NULL,865874.0,865874.0,5647322,2,6.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

As a general rule it is a good idea to pull all logic executed in your jsp's that do not have anything to do with your presentation out into seperate services you then can call from within your servlets/jsp's.

1162,6996286,6996337,3,I would like to remove the if ... then ... else ... keywords because I am embedding a language/DSL in Haskell. if then and else convey a lot of meaning in many domains and it would be great if I could redefine (or leave them undefined) them to reflect the nature of the language/domain. I've searched on Google and stackoverflow but found nothing. (I did find an old thread on why if ... then ... else ... was included as keywords in Haskell.) My IDE is in Leksah and if the keywords can be removed it would also be nice to have a setting to change the if ... then ... else ... keywords back to their normal font/color/unbold.  I've already tried a naming convention of if' for if and so on. It doesn't feel as good especially when I want to define if and if' and have to define if' and if'' instead or if1 and if2. The presence of both if' and if might also be confusing. (The confusion is not that serious an issue in my situation as the users of the DSL are Haskell programmers but I suppose it can help in other situations).  Summarizing the responses to date:  Use the RebindableSyntax extension to GHC. Not as general as removing the keywords: the syntax of Haskell's if-then-else is retained. (Frerich Raabe) Workaround: Use very similar words/names by using data Conditional b a = If b (Then a) (Else a) (only applicable in some contexts). (C. A. McCann)  If RebindableSyntax is a relatively new feature then it's unlikely to find a more general way at least not till the next version of GHC. ,4.0,2023-08-09,3,2023-08-10,NULL,691422.0,691422.0,0,1,16.0,<haskell><ghc><leksah>,"""How could I remove the """"if ... then ... else ..."""" keywords in Haskell (GHC)?""",1276.0

1188,7012697,0,0,As Greg B suggested you could create the skeletons images just changing the highlighted number such as: Images/Figure_Human_Image1.png    : this is your original image with no highlight Images/Figure_Human_Image1_h1.png : this is the skeleton image with number 1 highlighted Images/Figure_Human_Image1_h2.png : this is the skeleton image with number 2 highlighted and so on...  Then you use jquery to switch the source of the image with the correct image highlighted been replaced. If the user clicked on number 1 than you replace the src with the image 'Images/Figure_Human_Image1_h1.png' You can do that by adding a click event in area through jquery. In your case the title attribute of the tag area correspond to the number clicked so it would be something like this: $('area').click(function(){     var number = $(this).attr('title');     $('img').attr('src''Images/Figure_Human_Image1_h'+number+'.png'); })  ,2.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,831790.0,831790.0,7009159,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

1215,7012672,7012773,1,I am using NSOperation to perform some heavy parsing of data then return back to the main thread with objects ready to be used by my app. I handle all operations by placing them on a singleton NSOperationQueue. I do this to control how much processing is happening at any point because each operation temporarily uses a pretty high memory footprint.  So I have a scenario where I can have several view controllers on screen. Each view controller will create a parsing operation on load and add it to the queue. I allow 2 concurrent processing operations by setting the maxConcurrentOperationCount. Each view controller creates a processing operation places it on the singleton queue and retains the operation as a property so it has a handle on it. If the view controller needs to go away in response to a user initiated Delete action I use the NSOperation property in the dealloc method of my view controller to cancel the operation: -(void)dealloc{     [self.currentOperation cancel];     [super dealloc]; }  In my NSOperation subclass I check the isCancelled property in several places (mostly before significant chunks of long running work) the isCancelled property and attempt to respond to it: if([self isCancelled]){     // Perform cleanup     return; }  The problem is that the isCancelled property is evaluating to false and the operation continues eventually calling into Core Data to attempt to retrieve data that has been deleted. I see this happen even when I place an isCancelled check immediately prior to the Core Data fetch request.  I've got a workaround to keep the app from crashing but I'm thinking I might be going about the implementation wrong. Is there any other way I can maintain a handle on the operation while it is processing so I can cancel it if needed? Is my method not retaining the proper handle on the operation and preventing it from being properly cancelled? ,1.0,2023-08-10,1,2023-08-10,NULL,1284.0,1284.0,0,1,0.0,<ios><nsoperation><nsoperationqueue>,NSOperation not being properly cancelled,1302.0

The easiest method to convert it is this: lua_Number a = 3.7; int b; b = static_cast(a)  However b will be 3. If you want to round it you can do something like this: lua_Number a = 3.7; int b; b = static_cast(a+0.5)  This way you can ensure that every number which has a suffix higher or equal to 0.5 is rounded.

1250,7005127,0,0,If you run into timer granularity issues I would suggest using good old Sleep() with a spin loop. Essentially the code should do something like: void PrecisionSleep(uint64 microSec) {     uint64 start_time;      start_time = GetCurrentTime(); // assuming GetCurrentTime() returns microsecs      // Calculate number of 10ms intervals using standard OS sleep.     Sleep(10*(microSec/10000)); // assuming Sleep() takes millisecs as argument      // Spin loop to spend the rest of the time in     while(GetCurrentTime() - start_time < microSec)     {} }  This way you will have a high precision sleep which wouldn't tax your CPU much if a lot of them are larger than the scheduling granularity (assumed 10ms). You can send your packets in a loop while you use the high precision sleep to time them. The reason audio works fine on most systems is that the audio device has its own clock. You just buffer the audio data to it and it takes care of playing it and interrupts the program when the buffer is empty. In fact a time skew between the audio card clock and the CPU clock can cause problems if a playback engine relies on the CPU clock. EDIT:     You can make a timer abstraction out of this by using a thread which uses a lock protected min heap of timed entries (the heap comparison is done on the expiry timestamp) and then you can either callback() or SetEvent() when the PrecisionSleep() to the next timestamp completes. ,4.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,860637.0,860637.0,7004721,2,0.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

1263,7013104,0,2,I'm converting an iPhone app to the iPad and I'm getting stuck on an innocent and seemingly trivial positioning problem. I have a UITableViewCell that only contains a UISwitch centered in the cell. The cell is in a UITableView with the Grouped style.  On the iPhone I merely set the center property of the switch to the center of the cell in tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:. That suffices for the iPhone because the center of the cell is the same regardless of table style. This happens on the iPhone too but the offset is smaller so the difference is more subtle. Here's the code for the iPhone:     cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];     UISwitch *view = [[UISwitch alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];     [view addTarget:self action:@selector(switchChanged:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];     view.center = cell.center;             cell.selectionStyle = UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone;     [cell.contentView addSubview:view];     [view release];  On the iPad without changing any code the position of the switch is still in the center of an iPhone screen. That's bad since iPad is way bigger than iPhone. So I moved the positioning code to tableView:willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath: and now it's on the other side of center (closer to the right side of the screen).  -(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willDisplayCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { UISwitch *s = (UISwitch *)[cell.contentView viewWithTag:SwitchTag]; s.center = CGPointMake(cell.contentView.center.xs.center.y); //pushes the switch too far to the right  } And yet when I log the various coordinates and frames that I'm interested in I get what I expect: the x coordinate of the center of the cell is at 384.0 which is half the screen width. I've also tried recalculating the whole frame of the UISwitch but since I'm using the values of the screen the switch ends up in the same spot too far to the right. What I think is going on is that there is some transform after tableView:willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath: is called (or before even) to render all those numbers meaningless. It almost looks as if the whole cell gets shifted by x where x is the distance from the edge of the screen to the start of the cell even though that's  not reported in the frame property. I'm sure there's something trivial I'm missing.

1302,7005244,0,0,Technically the file is been read using a charset of UTF-8 as you told the InputStreamReader to do so. The underlying bytes of the file content are been interpreted using UTF-8. The readLine() method returns a String which stores the characters internally in Java's own UTF-16 charset.  What happens thereafter is fully dependent on what you're doing with this String. If you're writing it back to a file using a Writer without specifying the charset then the platform's default will be used. If you're displaying it to the stdout then the stdout's default charset will be used which is dependent on the runtime environment (command console? IDE? etc). If you're saving it in a database then it's dependent on the JDBC driver configuration and/or the DB table encoding. Etcetera. Apparently you're printing it to stdout in Eclipse's console by System.out.println(). In that case the GBK charset will be used to display the characters. That would malform any originally read UTF-8 characters which are not covered by GBK. You'd need to configure Eclipse to use UTF-8 as text file encoding.

1329,7005494,0,0,Yes generally there is a 'server' that multiple clients connect to. The server accepts messages from one client and forwards it to one or more other clients. This is almost always 'asynchronous' but that can mean a few things (whether it is done that way on the client or server whether the server is 'event driven' or multithreaded etc). The server can be a web server but other kinds exist (Jabber servers for example which use XMPP usually [or often] on port 5222). Some messengers work over HTTP (usually port 80 usually open) and even when a protocol usually uses a different port a 'web gateway' can be written to communicate over port 80 and HTTP to avoid problems with other ports being blocked and it can forward to the 'standard server' or re-implement it entirely. Especially in corporate environments internet access can be me mediated by an HTTP proxy server so using a gateway or native HTTP messaging apps/protocols is the only option. I guess it's important to define 'server' correctly for these discussions. Often the term is used to describe an actual computer sitting in a data center or something. But when we talk about a 'web server' or 'jabber server' we usually mean a software daemon that is a piece of software who's job it is to listen for client connections and act on the messages it receives. ,1.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,338803.0,338803.0,7005455,2,3.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

1341,7013229,0,0,This seems like a pretty bad plan. If users of the type need data then that type should expose methods to return that data. Why are people parsing the string representation of an object when they have access to the object? There are of course serialization scenarios but those are well-defined and rarely use .ToString() to do their job. If the textual representation of a string for non-output purposes is required then I would prefer a separate method (that may or may not utilize ToString() to do its job.) This helps consumers as well as implementors; it would be really unfortunate if a new coder wanted to add some debug dump info in ToString() and broke the class's consumers. UPDATE: As MattDavey points out if you implement IFormattable then that's a good compromise: your consumers call ToString() but with specific formats in mind and reliable contract of what that means.

1342,7005355,0,0,1- You are looking for array e.g.  $files=array(11=>'abc.zip'              12=>'xyz.zip');  2- The Query String is accessed by the super global $_GET so in your case $_GET['file'] holds that data you are interested in. 345    I would recommend storing the information JSON encoded. e.g. $rawInfo=file_get_contents('stats.log'); $Info=json_decode($rawInfotrue); if(isset($Info[$_GET['file']])){     $Info[$_GET['file']]++; }else{     $Info[$_GET['file']]=1; } $rawInfo=json_encode($Info); $h=fopen('stats.log''c');// If $h is false you couldn't open the file flock($hLOCK_EX);// lock the file $b=fwrite($h$rawInfo);// if $b is not greater than 0 nothing was written flock($hLOCK_UN); fclose($h); //And then actually serve the file requested  This has the advantage of storing the information already in a useful format. Whenever you fetch out the json_decodeed data it is in the format of an array which you will need to know how to handle. stats.php might look something like this: $rStats=file_get_contents('stats.log'); $Stats=json_decode($rStatstrue); foreach($Stats as $k=>$v){    echo $k.': '.$v.' download'.($v==1?'':'s'); }  ,5.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,635766.0,635766.0,7005267,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

1344,6989671,6989775,1,This is a weird thing I've been encountering and I was wondering if people could give me a few pointers on where to look for problems. What I'm doing is running a find for an id on a model. When I run it on a certain set of records they return that record as expected. But there's another 100 records or so that I can see in the database (mysql) but running a find command returns an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception. If I create another record directly in the database I cannot pull up that record either. However if I do a new command in the rails console that record is retrievable. If I do a find_by_sql command the records are retrievable. I've tried optimizing the table but beyond that I'm kind of stumped as to what would be causing this. I'm running Rails 2.3.12 with Ruby 1.8.7 and the mysql gem on my local machine. Any thoughts on possible causes would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Edit Thanks for the pointers - attached a logger to my console instance which exposed the problem - a forgotten default_scope which was restricting what was returned.  ,2.0,2023-08-08,0,2023-08-10,NULL,738914.0,738914.0,0,1,1.0,<mysql><ruby-on-rails><activerecord><arel>,Rails find not returning a record that exists in the database,240.0

1380,7013664,0,0,I asume your site is reachable by two domains but you want all request to your site redirected to one of them. Then the correct code is: RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^mydomain\.com$ [NC] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^$ RewriteRule ^(.*)$  [R=permanentL]  You should place that code directly after the redirect line. The second line makes sure that there is no redirect if no Host is given (to prevent a redirect loop in that case). The [R=permanentL] in the third line makes it a permanent redirect and prevents any further rule processing. The other rules will be processed once the redirect has taken place.  The full file would then be: Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine on RewriteBase /  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^mydomain\.com$ [NC] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^$ RewriteRule ^(.*)$  [R=permanentL]  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /app/core.php [LNCQSA]  ,8.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,758345.0,758345.0,7013506,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

1383,7005825,7006219,3,Ok so here's my current setup and my problem at the moment. I have a growing set of projects in a Visual Studio solution. The solution contains about 15 projects (give or take a few) and a quickly growing code-base. I realize that I should have had a continuous build system set-up before I got to this but its never too late I suppose. So after doing a little research I believe that my perfect setup would be:  NUnit 2.5.x (we are already tied to this... so a necessity) Integration with CruiseControl.Net (open to other options but only free ones with Git support) Integration with a code-coverage tool (NCover DotCover) would be nice Integration to run shell commands (for JSLint and compression tools etc.)  What I am missing is a tool to run the automated build. I looked at NAnt but it's support for running MSBuild (to build the project) seemed fairly outdated (we're using VS2010) and utilizing the solution files in our build process would be a HUGE time saver. I also looked at MSBuild (for the obvious reasons) but the process that I found for running NUnit tests only supports 2.4.x (MSBuild extensions project).  I am curious how everyone else has organized their continuous build systems. NUnit if fairly popular so I must not be the only one who is wondering about this.  ,5.0,2023-08-10,1,2023-08-10,user131441,0.0,0.0,0,1,4.0,<c#><msbuild><nunit><continuous-integration><nant>,Continuous Integration/Builds with NUnit 2.5.x and .Net 4.0,1782.0

It seems the simplest way to do this is to iterate through every single data point and measure the multidimensional distance to my input point; but speed is of the essence! I read about something called K-D Trees used for this purpose. Can anyone please explain or provide me with some material that explains how to implement this in MYSQL? It may be relevant to mention that I can pre-process the table but the input is received in real-time.  Currently I just make a rough cluster around the data on each dimension independently: INSERT INTO Dim1 SELECT * FROM myTable AS myTable USE INDEX(M1) WHERE myTable.M1 < currentM1 ORDER BY M1 DESC LIMIT 2500; INSERT INTO Dim1 SELECT * FROM myTable AS myTable USE INDEX(M1) WHERE myTable.M1 > currentM1 ORDER BY M1  ASC LIMIT 2500;  INSERT INTO Dim2 SELECT * FROM myTable AS myTable USE INDEX(M2) WHERE myTable.M2 < currentM2 ORDER BY M2 DESC LIMIT 2500; INSERT INTO Dim2 SELECT * FROM myTable AS myTable USE INDEX(M2) WHERE myTable.M2 > currentM2 ORDER BY M2  ASC LIMIT 2500;  INSERT INTO Dim3 SELECT * FROM myTable AS myTable USE INDEX(M3) WHERE myTable.M3 < currentM3 ORDER BY M3 DESC LIMIT 2500; INSERT INTO Dim3 SELECT * FROM myTable AS myTable USE INDEX(M3) WHERE myTable.M3 > currentM3 ORDER BY M3  ASC LIMIT 2500;  INSERT INTO Dim4 SELECT * FROM myTable AS myTable USE INDEX(M4) WHERE myTable.M4 < currentM4 ORDER BY M4 DESC LIMIT 2500; INSERT INTO Dim4 SELECT * FROM myTable AS myTable USE INDEX(M4) WHERE myTable.M4 > currentM4 ORDER BY M4  ASC LIMIT 2500;  It is important to understand that I am interested in distance by rank not by value. Edit: I am a little closer to understanding how to do it (I think): I need to pre-process each row of each metric and assign it a percentile which would represent its location (percent-wise) in its range.  For example for any given value of M1: percentile = (#  rows with values less than input)/(# total rows)   If I calculate the input's percentile and use that for a nearest neighbor search instead of the actual value I will have effectively scaled the various metrics such that they could be used as dimensions. I am still lost on how to do the actual search though. Is this even possible to accomplish efficiently in MySQL? ,9.0,2023-08-10,3,2023-08-10,NULL,737297.0,737297.0,0,1,4.0,<mysql><sql><multidimensional-array><nearest-neighbor><kdtree>,Implementing a k-d tree for 'nearest neighbor' search in MYSQL?,1595.0

My way of solving this problem would be to write a function and then apply this function to every file in the directory/subdirectories. Assuming that you have multiple cores/processors and that your function would be doing something more CPU consuming than just renaming and copying files you would also parallelize the task. The bash script would look like this: #! /bin/bash n=1 CopyAndRename() {    NEWNAME=$n.xx    cp """"$i"""" /newdir/$NEWNAME     n=$[$n+1] }  IFS=$'\n' LIST=`find /dir -type f`  for i in $LIST; do    CopyAndRename $i done  This should also handle filenames with whitespaces and other special characters. For parallelization you could use a program prll and then replace the for loop with prll CopyAndRename $LIST  But this really isn't necessary for renaming and copying.

1465,7006280,0,0,"""First of all indexing an array is not very expensive (only like one operation more expensive than a pointer dereference or sometimes none depending on the situation). Secondly most compilers will perform what is called RVO or return value optimisation when returning structs by value. This is where the caller allocates space for the return value of the function it calls and secretly passes the address of that memory to the function for it to use and the effect is that no copies are made. It does this automatically so struct mystruct blah = func();  Only constructs one object passes it to func for it to use transparently to the programmer and no copying need be done. What I do not know is if you assign an array index the return value of the function like this: someArray[0] = func();  will the compiler pass the address of someArray[0] and do RVO that way or will it just not do that optimisation? You'll have to get a more experienced programmer to answer that. I would guess that the compiler is smart enough to do it though but it's just a guess. And yes I would call it micro optimisation. But we're C programmers. And that's how we roll. """,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,726361.0,726361.0,7006225,2,2.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

Almost every class has an interface to it which is called classnameable. In the code database.class would never appear even once but in place where I would want to use that class I see databaseable.class.  To my understanding an interface was a class that was never implemented but was inhereted from to keep standards.

1475,7013907,0,0,Without knowing how you allocated the array what this could possible mean is the 2D-array was allocated with the first pointer pointing to the entire memory buffer allocated via malloc() and the rest of the pointers in the pointer-array are pointing into the memory buffer.  Therefore once you've called free on the first pointer in the pointer array you've actually deallocated the entire memory buffer ... calling free again on an other pointer in the array will be trying to free memory that has already been deallocated. For instance the array could have been allocated using the following technique: int** ptr_array = malloc(sizeof(int*) * NUM_ROWS); *ptr_array = malloc(sizeof(int) * NUM_ROWS * NUM_COLUMNS);  int* temp = *ptr_array; for (int i=0; i < NUM_ROWS; i++) {     ptr_array[i] = temp;     temp += NUM_COLUMNS; }  ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,649233.0,649233.0,7013821,2,0.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

If you could change them it would be best just to pass the socket as first parameter to your functions. Another way is to move the definition of currentSocket and your functions inside of the io.sockets connection callback. In this case the currentSocket variable forms a closure and everything should work as expected: io.sockets.on('connection' function (socket) {   var currentSocket = socket;   socket.on('msg' function (data) {     global[data.functionToInvoke];   });    //global function that I can't change or even analyze/read   //========================================================   function g1(){      //might use currentSocket      //might invoke async stuff like      fs.readfile(...cb)   }   function g2(){      //might use currentSocket      //might invoke async stuff like      redisClient.get(...cb)   }  });  ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,511300.0,511300.0,6457540,2,2.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

If the date is present I copy the list items to another list BBB else I add empty values to the list BBB. The problem I am having is that with my actual code is I don`t know how not pass through the false statement of the while loop till it reaches the end of the comparison. With the code below it is passing both the true and false in the while loop which is falsifying the required result. The result I am obtaining is for every time that is present I am having the same time as false.  In short lets say the list contains the date 6/5/2010 and the range of date is 4/5/2010 to 7/5/2010.  so I will have an item created in the true part and AN ITEM CREATED INTHE FALSE PART which is wrong.

Is this all I would have to do to get my second partition mounted in Android or do I also need to create /sdcard2 like /sdcard? I presume both are created as symlinks by vold as specified in this conf file but I have not had time to check yet.  I would ask forums but this seems like a developer question and this is the most recent release of the OS. It seems to change a lot from version to version of the OS.

1518,7006499,7006537,4,I have a class which reads data from port through TcpClient. I've created 2 threads.   Packet Reading Thread Packet Processing Thread  1 Thread continuously reads bytes and once it gets a proper packet it adds that packet in a Queue and initiates the 2nd thread which then reads packet from that Queue and processes it. The packet processing should be done sequentially. Therefore each time when the reading thread adds the packet in Queue it checks that whether that Processing Thread is running or NOT. If NOT then it again starts that thread. This is because we don't want multiple packet processing threads running simultaneously. Now my question is actually related to that checking part. What I've done is that I've added a simple bool variable in my class. And when I get into the packet processing thread I set that bool = true. While packet reading thread checks this bool variable if it is true then it knows that the processing thread is running. And when packet processing thread reaches at end it sets that bool = false. Is this the correct way? Or is this approach prone to race condition? Thanks. Update (a little detail): delegate void PacketProcessDelegate(); PacketProcessDelegate PacketProcess = new PacketProcessDelegate(this.PacketProcessingThread);  PacketReadingThread() {     Packet = GetPacket();  // thread blocks until packet is NOT received     Queue.Synchronized(this.Queue).Enque(Packet);     if (!this.IsProcessing)         this.PacketProcess.BeginInvoke(null null); }  PacketProcessingThread() {     this.IsProcessing=true;     while(true) {         Queue syncQueue;         syncQueueu = Queue.Synchronized(this.Queue);         if(syncQueueu.Count > 0)             //packet extraction and processing code here         else             break;     }     this.IsProcessing=false; }  Goals: Packet Processing thread either *) should be terminated and should be restarted but ThreadPool should be utilized in order to prevent creation of a new thread each time. Thats why I've used the BeginInvoke. OR *) it should be blocked somehow until another packet is NOT received. ,5.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,869430.0,869430.0,0,1,0.0,<.net><multithreading>,Thread End checking from another Thread,86.0

You can unzip them and zip them up again really easily as and when needed and in Rails generating an XML file is dead simple using SomeModel.to_xml the output of which can easily be sent to a file so maintaining them will be a simple too. You can just as eaily work this the other way round so that when it comes to reading the data in you can simply convert the data back into a model (Rails 3.x has ActiveModel which would be ideal for this scenario as the data is not backed by a database but you still get a ActiveRecord API and all the juice that AR gives you meaning that your views controllers etc are working with a consistent api and consistent behaviour.

1554,7014391,0,0,A couple things in your code don't really make sense. First you're trying to iterate through $totalreceivers twice one loop being nested in the other. I doubt that's what you want so you should get rid of one of them. And your first loop has a bad expression: to iterate through $totalreceivers in your first for loop you need to have your testing expression go against the number of elements in the array and not the array itself (can use count()): for ($i = 0; $i < count($totalreceivers); $i++).   Second you're resetting the value of $status each time you call status() in your loop. To add to it use the += operator: $status += status($receivers[$i]); Third you're doing the same in status() function with $rowservice; resetting it each iteration of that while loop. Either set it once or sum it up. ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,550309.0,550309.0,7014275,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

Here is an example: actor = [actor for actor in self.actors if actor.name==actorName][0]  (self.actors contains a list of objects and I'm trying to get to the one with a specific (string) name which is in actorName.) I'm trying to pull out the object from the list that matches the parameter I'm looking for.  Is this method unreasonable?

Both of those issues can be resolved by adding an extra tag around your HTML before calling those methods.

1595,7006892,0,0,I'm a bit concerned that the code generated for if (wsdHooks.xBenignBegin) isn't very general.  It assumes the only true value is 1 whereas it should really be testing for any nonzero value.  Still MSVC is sometimes baffling that way.  It is probably nothing.  Never mind:  these instructions are for C code not presented. Given that the eflag Z bit is clear and EAX is zero the code did not get here by executing the instruction 719f9fa7    test    eaxeax  There must be a jump from somewhere else to the instruction following (719f9fa9 je     SQLite_Interop!pcache1Fetch+0x2d) or even the call instruction itself. Another complication is that with the x86 family it is common for an invalid jump target (like the second byte of the JE instruction) to execute unperturbed (no faults) for quite a few instructions often eventually getting back on the proper instruction alignment.  Said another way you may not be looking for a jump to the beginning of any of these instructions:  a jump might be in the midst of their bytes resulting in executing unremarkable operations like add [al+ebp]al which tend not to be noticed. I predict that a breakpoint at the test instruction will not be hit for the exception.  The only ways to find such causes is either to be very lucky or to suspect everything and prove them innocent one-by-one. ,5.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,198536.0,198536.0,7004728,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

I won't speak to whether or not this is proper form (hopefullt you are using something like PresentationModel or MVC) as I do know tehre are times code like this is required. Now as has been pointed out if you plan on showing the user control in the form then a different solution should be adopted. But it all depends on how you are planning on what you are doing with the form. If you are for example showing teh form in a dialog keeping a class level reference is a bad idea since once closed the form will be disposed.

The model-loading method returns more objects so I want it to @return My\BaseModel and then put the /* @var $model Model\Article */ for each model specificaly (when I use it). The problem is that the @return Model\Article works well (I see Model\Article + My\BaseModel methods) but the other way (@return My\BaseModel and inline /*...*/) doesn't - it say's 'No completions available'.

So based on the user selection i have to generate a report in which for each building a different table has to be created over jsp page. So the table should be like one building name in first column and the chosen subsystem in second column rows. Other columns have heading 2011 2012 upto 2016.Hence there can be multiple table but with same set of subsystems at a time. The values in other blocks comes in based on some calculation. Its kind of forecast report in which if for eg. roofing for some building has renewal cost in 2011 then its value should come at right place.  And finally i have to get the total at the bottom of each table and further a table in which must be having grand total for each column. here is the sample table for better understanding:-  So can anyone suggest me what approach i should take.

Plus there might be a minor penalty until the VM can inline the extra layers. Either way you see a decrease in bugs and an increase in developer productivity. DI is especially nice for production. In our software we use the exact same configuration in production as we do in tests.  When the tests are run the test configuration just flags certain services as being mocked out. This means that the test configuration is:  list out mocked out services specify return values for the various method calls on the mocked out service methods.  Test Benefits:  No config differences between production and test means no possibility of a latent config dependent bug Services are injected in to the Test class as well. Test configuration is trivial (only needed really for cases where services are mocked out) Test configuration is always same as production. ( easier to maintain ) Service initialization is never manual and hacked together.  Production Benefits:  Clean start up code - no hard coded dependencies Circular dependencies are not an issue.

1671,7014893,0,0,In your code returnArray returns a pointer to the first element of myArray which is local to the function. When the function returns the memory of its local variables gets released as the call stack is popped so it can be used for other purposes. In this case since you call printArray afterwards the stack area originally occupied by returnArray gets reused for printArray so the memory that originally contained myArray now has unpredictable content. As James Kanze pointed out the best way to accomplish what you want would probably be to use std::vector instead of int* something like this std::vector returnArray() {     int myArray[5] = { 1 2 3 4 5 };     std::vector result(myArray myArray + 5);     return result }  And modify the other functions accordingly to take a vector.

1693,7014990,0,0,My suggestion: Create a previous_points column and then issue this simple query each night: UPDATE table SET previous_points = points;  Then to display ranks by the current or previous day simply use points or previous_points respectively. Edit You could use temporary tables to make use of this data. Here is an example: 1: Make a temporary table populated with today's rankings: SET @rank := 0; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ranks_today     (id INT(8) rank INT(6) previous_rank INT(6))     SELECT id @rank:= @rank + 1 AS rank     FROM users     ORDER BY points DESC;  2: A temporary table for yesterday's rankings: SET @rank := 0; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ranks_yesterday     (id INT(8) rank INT(6))     SELECT id @rank:= @rank + 1 AS rank     FROM users     ORDER BY previous_points DESC;  3: Now we'll copy yesterday's rankings to today's table for convenience: UPDATE ranks_today ranks_yesterday SET ranks_today.previous_rank = ranks_yesterday.rank WHERE ranks_today.id = ranks_yesterday.id;  4: Finally a query that shows the user's name ranks for today and yesterday as well as the change: SELECT u.name t.rank t.previous_rank t.previous_rank - t.rank `change` FROM ranks_today t users u WHERE u.id = t.id;  You could optionally create rank and previous_rank columns in your users table if you want and update those in step 3.

However the only way that I can think of to let the superview know that it should call layoutSubviews: is by overriding that method in each of its subviews something that I would like to try and avoid (I want people to be able to add arbitrary UIViews to the superview and have this taken care of). Is there a way for the superview to call layoutSubviews: whenever a subview changes its size without adding any code to the subview in question? ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,571461.0,571461.0,0,1,3.0,<iphone><cocoa-touch><uiview><uikit><layoutsubviews>,Possible to make superView intercept layoutSubviews: from subviews?,801.0

Put them in two different computers and make them run. so each will turn on their Bluetooth antennas and then the Two applications will connect using the bluetooth and a file is sent from one to the other. thats really all. How can I basically achieve this can someone guide me? Also I got 2 questions:  How can i set one application to broadcast a message that it exists over bluetooth. How can the other detect this and connect to that computer using Bluetooth  One idea i have is to connect to each nearby computer iteratively and then search if the application exists and then pair them automatically through the application itself (not by windows manually) and send the file. ,0.0,2023-08-09,0,2023-08-10,NULL,70386.0,331179.0,0,1,1.0,<c#><sockets><network-programming><bluetooth><file-transfer>,Creating basic file transfer between 2 applications on 2 computers using bluetooth in C#,1110.0

1723,7017451,0,0,You can try dict.rehash(n) with different (large) values of n before inserting elements and see how this impacts performance. Memory allocations (they take place when the container fills buckets) are generally more expensive in C++ than in C# and rehashing is also heavy. For std::vector and std::deque the analog member function is reserve. Different rehash policies and load factor threshold (have a look at the max_load_factor member function) will also greatly impact unordered_map's performance. Next since you're using VS2010 I suggest you use std::unordered_map from the  header. Don't use boost when you can use the standard library. The actual hash function used may greatly impact performance. You may try with the following: struct custom_hash { size_t operator()(int x) const { return x; } };  and use std::unordered_map. Finally I agree that this is a poor usage of hash tables. Use random values for insertion you'll get a more precise picture of what is going on. Testing insertion speeds of hash tables isn't stupid at all but hash tables are not meant to store consecutive integers. Use a vector for this. ,1.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,373025.0,373025.0,6974719,2,3.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

Implement after triggers for insert update delete on both tables. This way referential constraints will kick in and report back to the user accurately.  Delete and Insert triggers must check if the record already exists to prevent generating an error which will be sent back to the user.

1741,7007344,0,0,Even if I can not answer your question at the moment I can give you some hints. First there are the some statements you wrote in your question:  1) Move the above declaration to very top of the web.xml 2) Slap @Transactional around my controller method and/or whole class     1) The order in which the filters are applied is defined by the order of Filters in the web.xml -- So it is correct that the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter must run before any other filter that use the Entitys. But in most cases there there are not so much filters that relay on Entities. (my the Security filter if you have extended it) -- But what I do not know is if it is correct to put the filters after the servlet declaration 2) If the Layz Init Exception is thrown in a JSP then this is defently wrong because it can not influence the JSP   But what me scared a bit (except from the order in you web.xml that makes it not realy easy to read) is the sitemash filter. My first guess is that sitemash causes the problem. If it is not to complicated then remove the sitemash filter only for an test. If the problem disapear then you have identified the causing component.  ,2.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,280244.0,280244.0,7003152,2,0.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

1782,7003118,0,0,I have a page with a grid of items. Each of these items can be dragged onto one of four divs and gets added to that div. This is done using jQuery and JQuery UI draggable/droppable. The first isotope item can be dragged onto any of the divs. However the 2nd & 3rd isotope items don't recognize the first droppable div but when dragged onto the 2nd droppable div will be added to the first droppable div.  The 4th & 5th draggable items (isotopes) don't recognize the first or second droppable div but when dragged over the 3rd droppable gets added to the 2nd droppable.  So somehow the droppable is getting confused as to where the items are being dropped.  When I comment out the following code the drag and drops work properly. Any ideas as to why this code would affect the droppable areas??  jQuery('div.container').isotope({  itemSelector: 'div.sub-item'   resizesContainer : false  layoutMode : 'fitColumns'  getSortData :{     fitOrder : function ($item){     var order         index = $item.index();        if($item.hasClass('sub-item-big') && index % 2) {             order = index +1.5;             } else {             order = index;             }         return order;        }    }  sortBy : 'fitOrder' });  --------------- update ------------------ After some more playing around with this I decided to add 'destroy' the isotope upon initiating a drag.     jQuery('div.sub-item').draggable({          helper: function(){                 jQuery('div.container').isotope('destroy');                 return jQuery(this).clone().appendTo('body');           }     })  When I run it this way the items are being dropped into the correct container.  The isotope documentation says their is a 'remove' function there are two problems with that.  1) the documentation says it removes the 'specified item elements from Isotope widget and the DOM' but I don't want to remove the item from the widget or from the dom I just want to remove the isotope functionality 2) I get an error 'cannot call methods on isotope prior to initialization attempted to call method remove' - but in this case the isotope was initialized but possibly not on the object that was cloned??

1787,7011406,7011681,1,I am working on an event management system for my work the basic function of it is to allow people in my office to upload new events to the system track them and edit them.  It is for the most part complete and now I am at the point of cleaning up the system and making it more user friendly. One of the biggest issues I am having is with maintaining view state. I am currently using one search page to filter all of my event results the user can search by date date range client etc and as long as the user stays on the page the system works as intended and all of the search function setting stay as they were.  There are some functions such as the edit link that open a new page (same window) where the event is edited and saved. This also works as intended I pass a queryString to the page to tell the system which one to edit. The problem is the back button. If I use a link that just links to the search page I loose all my settings which is kind of annoying if you want to see the changes you just made to the event I tried a JavaScript back which maintains your viewstate but the page does not refresh so any edits don't show until the user refreshes. There are 3 times I use an outside link on this page and although it isn't a deal breaker and is just mildly annoying I would like to figure it out as it has been bothering me for sometime. I also tried making the edits in the page but could not figure that out easier and I figured this would be easier to fix.

You can as well set it deliberately with e. g. sock.bind(('' 54312)) before the sock.sendto() line. This could be useful in context where software checks the port range of the sender: Ports 0..1023 are privileged ports - under many OSes only root is allowed to bind to these ports. However in the very most cases there is no point in changing it so it mostly is better to leave it set the way it is.

1816,7015492,7015548,1,I've got a quick question. In my grails project I am making some web service calls. One of the calls (for a search function) tends to timeout if not enough characters are given to search for. I can't increase the number of required characters so I instead am trying to catch the exception and display an error page asking the user to add more detailed parameters. The method looks like this: import org.apache.  class RestSearchService implements SearchService {     List getPersonSearch( String fName String lName) throws HttpResponseException {         ...         //  Make the call         ...     } }  I then catch the thrown exception in the controller to redirect to the error page. I've tested it and this code appears to work fine. The problem is that the method above is underlined (I'm using SpringSource Tool Suite for an IDE) and says  Exception HttpResponseException is not compatible with  throws clause in SearchService.getPersonSearch(String String)  Does anyone know what might be causing this? Also might it mean that there is an actual problem or circumstance where this will cause the app to break? Like I said from what I can tell the throw/redirect is working like a champ but that error makes me nervous about moving the app to production.

With MSVC semantics you are guaranteed that as soon as you see instance != 0 the object has finished being initialized (which is not the case without proper barrier semantics even with traditional volatile semantics). This double-checked lock (anti-)pattern is quite common actually and broken if you don't provide barrier semantics. However if there are guarantees that accesses to volatile variables are acquire + release barriers then it works.  Don't rely on such custom semantics of volatile though. I suspect this has been introduced not to break existing codebases. In any way don't write locks according to MSDN example. It probably doesn't work (I doubt you can write a lock using just a barrier: you need atomic operations -- CAS TAS etc -- for that). The only portable way to write the double-checked lock pattern is to use C++0x which provides a suitable memory model and explicit barriers. ,4.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,373025.0,373025.0,7007403,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

Currently i have written this: int count = 0;     for (int i = 0; i<args.length -1; ++i)         count++;     System.out.println(count);       }  int nums[] = new int[] { 23 1 5 78 22 4}; double result = 0; //average will have decimal point     {     for(int i=0; i < nums.length; i++){     result += nums[i];     }     System.out.println(result/count)  }  Can anyone guide me in the right direction? Or give an example that guides me in the write way to shape this code?

1907,7012127,7015903,2,I've just got a contract to develop a kind of billing application for internet cafe to monitor  calls on their VoIP phones. Here's the main idea how the app should work. Say that I borrow someone a phone #2 and he makes 10 calls to different places with possibly different call rates e.g. calling to different country. After he gives me the phone back I need to see how much money does he need to pay in total based on all the rates of all the calls he made. The problem is that I've never worked with VoIP so I'm unable to estimate how difficult it would be to develop a system like that. From my point of view the one problematic part is somehow getting to the data about all the calls that were made. Once I know incoming/outgoing number length and other stuff for each call it should be relatively simple to process and display the data in correct format. I guess that for developing such an application I'm going to have to set up VoIP gateway (Asterisk?) to just be able to test the application. One thing I'm afraid of are some kind of hidden problems like for example if I was to create some kind of proxy for all the calls there would be probably very high performance requirements etc. What kind of problems can I expect to come up while developing such a system? I'd prefer any Java related solutions or suggestions if possible. ,0.0,2023-08-10,1,2023-08-10,NULL,72583.0,72583.0,0,1,0.0,<java><voip><sip><asterisk>,How should I approach developing a system for logging calls from a VoIP phones?,276.0
1908,7003999,7007002,2,I'm having a little bit of trouble managing the load of sites in a Firefox extension. I'm using JavaScript and developing a Firefox extension to search a string in a list of websites of my own to look for bad words. The problem is that I am searching the list one by one. That means I am loading a webpage and I add an event listener to DOMContentLoaded; when the DOM loads a function is called to search for the string. But if the page does not load (A network issue for example) the function is never called. Is there a way to set a timer to an event listener? If the event is not triggered in 5 seconds then do something. Or if there is another way to do that please advice!

1942,7018161,0,1,I created an installer for MVVM Light and part of the installation is about code snippets for Visual Studio 2010 2010 Express and 2008. Unfortunately the code snippets are installed into a folder with a LCID (culture code for instance 1033 for en-US). If the snippets are not in the correct folder/LCID Visual Studio doesn't load them (yes utterly stupid I know. But this is what we have...) When VS is installed in English all is well. However when a Geman (for instance) version of VS is found the snippets fail to register in VS. Is there a way in Wix to detect the LCID and to use that as a property in other words to install the snippets in the correct folder depending on the LCID? I know about multilanguage installers but it seems like a bazooka to kill a fly. Any other idea?

The IV can be transmitted along with the encrypted data in plain text. An IV should ideally be used only once. The main motivation behind using a changing IV is that encrypting the same thing twice should not result in the same ciphertext both times because this can allow an attacker to draw conclusions about the data encrypted. ,7.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,225467.0,225467.0,7008102,2,3.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

It is neither a linear representation of time nor a true representation of UTC (though it is frequently mistaken for both) as it cannot unambiguously represent UTC leap seconds (e.g. December 31 1998 23:59:60) although otherwise the times it represents are UTC.

Is there any data type that can store numbers in two-bytes or one-byte (something like short integer in C)?

This is a very important and urgent problem for me and your help would be greatly appreciated. If you know of a comprehensive help on writing to binary files please let me know. Thanks!

1995,7018429,0,0,Because you probably declared your property as retain or copy: @property (nonatomic retain) MyObject* myobject;  If you @synthesize that the compiler will generate code that looks more or less like: - (void) setMyobject: (MyObject *) value {     if (value != myobject)     {         [myobject release];         myobject = value;     } }  Each time you assign to self.myobject that method is invoked with the new object as value parameter. It should release the old object but the last object added is retained. You'll have to release it in your dealloc. And you should release what you allocated so the pattern is: MyObject *myObj = [[MyObject alloc] init]; self.myobject = myObj; [myObj release];  Items returned from a method are usually autoreleased so you should not release those: MyObject *myObj = [someOtherObject someMethod: 17]; self.myobject = myObj; // Do NOT release myObj!   Update See @omz's explanation. I misread and was talking about the setter. Your getter does a retain too but that is immediately paired with an autorelease.

The solutions vary wildly and I'm afraid of breaking something important or doing something very stupid. I am perfectly willing to use any other method of creating a new directory if one exists without me having to find some other library. I only minored in comp sci and frankly I have no idea why it's so easy to open close edit and otherwise access files through stdio but doing anything with directories (specifically making them and finding out if they exist) is a wild goose chase through the streets of the Internet.

1998,7016277,0,0,Sounds like you want a map which would work nicely using either std::unordered_map or std::map.  Since you mentioned that each class would inherit from a parent Tile class you could set the type of the map to something like std::map > tile_map;  Now you would setup the map by basically cycling through your indexes and creating Tiles allocated on the heap so that you could put tiles that are derived from Tile in your map.  For instance: tile_map[0] = new Derived_Tile_A(); tile_map[1] = new Derived_Tile_B(); //... keep adding to map  Accessing the elements of the map would be done through the int type key-values and would be done like a normal array-syntax except that the return value would be an interator pointing to a node with a data-element type of std::shared_ptr.  Once you dereference the iterator the shared_ptr can be operated on with normal pointer defererencing syntax. If you need to create a new object based on some condition the best thing would be to look into a factory function that would be based on a switch statement and return a pointer to the proper derived type.  You would then call the factory function when creating your objects for the std::map. ,0.0,2023-08-10,0,2023-08-10,NULL,649233.0,649233.0,7016123,2,1.0,NULL,NULL,0.0

This will avoid complex mod_rewrite rules where you try to map regex matched portions of the URL to a specific GET variable. The rewrite rule could look something like this redirecting any URL that starts with article/ to your php script: RewriteRule article/.* article.php  And when article.php is sent this request:   It could just explode on / and find the id. $requestParts = explode('/' $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; $id = $requestParts[1];  On a large scope you can rewrite all requests to the entire site to index.php and in a similar fashion determine not just what article to server but what script (article/user/etc) should handle each request. That's the basic concept of a 'Router' in many PHP frameworks. In that case it's important to not redirect all requests to your routing script (since many will be for static resources like images/css/javascript). To avoid that generally the rules redirect any request that is not a file on the server to the router script. Here's a sample mod_Rewrite that does that taken from the Zend Framework: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC",,,0,2023-08-10,0,,,45531,45531,7012510.0,2,1,

When you have a branch checked out (i.e. the file .git/HEAD contains a reference to the branch) and you make a commit Git moves that bookmark forward to point to the new commit. But this tracking behaviour doesn't apply here. As you may already know a submodule is pinned to a particular commit; it does not track a branch head. When you update a submodule Git checks out that particular commit only. That means .git/HEAD contains the commit hash not a branch ref. There may be one or more branch heads pointing to this commit but that's kind of irrelevant.

2026,7016562,0,0,C# Specifications:  10.6.2 Static and instance methods When a method declaration includes a static modifier that method is   said to be a static method. When no static modifier is present the   method is said to be an instance method. A static method does not operate on a specific instance and it is a   compile-time error to refer to this in a static method.  MSDN:  Static Members A static method field property or event is callable on a class even   when no instance of the class has been created. If any instances of   the class are created they cannot be used to access the static   member. Only one copy of static fields and events exists and static   methods and properties can only access static fields and static   events. Static members are often used to represent data or   calculations that do not change in response to object state; for   instance a math library might contain static methods for calculating   sine and cosine.  It seems to me like you are trying to to manage instances with static methods. If so consider using the singleton pattern if you only need to manage one instance at a time or have static methods manage a static list of instances. If not that method wouldn't static and thus would be useless unless it does more than just closeComm();.

2029,7016383,0,0,No the performance does not depend on the number of files that are in a directory. The reason why opening the folder in Windows explorer is slow is because it has to render icons and various other GUI related things for each file. When the web server fetches a file it doesn't need to do that. It just (more or less) directly goes to the location of the file on the disk. EDIT: Millions is kind of pushing the limits of your file system (I assume NTFS in your case). It appears that anything over 10000 files in a directory starts to degrade your performance.

I want to give my users the ability to search the table so I take a text string and pass it into my service layer to construct a query using Linq to Entities. I want to search a number of columns using the string. Some of the columns are integers (order ids) but the user doesn't care about integers and strings. They want to type '1200' and get any order with '1200' in the order number or '1200' in the address. The problem is that I can't find a way to construct a Linq-to-Entities query that results in SQL that looks like this: select orderid address from orders where orderid like '%1200%' or address like '%1200%'  Database context:      public DbSet Persons { get; set; }     public DbSet Workers { get; set; }     public DbSet WorkerSignins { get; set; }  The Persons and Workers tables are in a 1 to 0..1 relationship. If a worker record exists a person record must also exist. They share the same ID. A worker record doesn't have to exist however.  The Workers and WorkerSignins tables are related but it's not enforced because of a client requirement. The Worker has an id-card with a barcode number on it (dwccardnum) but there may be discrepancies between cards issued and records in the DB so I record all cards scanned in WorkerSignins regardless of whether there is a matching record in the Workers table.

Now we have requirements to create Website C which will be similar to Website A. Website C must also encrypt data and pass it to Website B. So the symmetric key must be stored in 3 locations. As we continue to deploy websites this symmetric key needs to be deployed in many places. It is a maintenance and security concern. Is there a better way to achieve the same result?

2054,7019061,0,0,The code sample you've given just plain doesn't work for starters but I would guess your problem has something to do with not even making a hashtable (dictionary? set?).

You then have a loop for x in (0 L):       a = L[x]       if a != user:          return False       else:          return True  which will actually just execute twice once with x = 0 and once with x = L where L is the len(L). Needless to say when you attempt to index into L the loop will fail. That won't even happen because you have an if-else that returns either way and L is not defined anywhere. What you are most likely looking for is a set with a check for the user do some work if they're absent then add the user.
